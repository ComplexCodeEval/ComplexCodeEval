Please intelligently complete the missing parts of the provided code snippet.\n\n### Task:\nBased on the provided code snippet, complete the missing function implementation. Ensure the code is logically correct, syntactically accurate, and follows best coding practices.\n\n### Code description\n```Python\n\"\"\"\nDescription: This function generates a graph from a given Atoms object.\n\nArgs:\n    atoms (Atoms): The Atoms object from which to generate the graph.\n\nReturns:\n    tuple[dgl.DGLGraph, torch.Tensor, list]: A tuple containing the generated graph, lattice matrix, and state attributes.\n\nDetails:\nThe function first checks if the Atoms object has periodic boundary conditions. If it does, it uses the find_points_in_spheres function from scipy.sparse to find the points within a certain cutoff distance. It then excludes self-interactions and interactions that are too close to the numerical tolerance. If the Atoms object does not have periodic boundary conditions, it calculates the distance between all pairs of atoms and creates an adjacency matrix. It then converts the adjacency matrix to a coordinate list format and excludes self-interactions.\n\nThe function then calls the get_graph_from_processed_structure method of the superclass to generate the graph. The superclass method takes the Atoms object, the source and destination indices of the edges, the periodic images of the edges, the lattice matrix, the element types, and the scaled positions (if periodic boundary conditions are present) or the cartesian coordinates (otherwise). It returns the generated graph, the lattice matrix, and the state attributes.\n\nThe function returns the generated graph, the lattice matrix, and the state attributes.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Code snippet:\n```Python\n    def get_graph(self, atoms: Atoms) -> tuple[dgl.DGLGraph, torch.Tensor, list]:\n        numerical_tol = 1.0e-8\n        pbc = np.array([1, 1, 1], dtype=int)\n        element_types = self.element_types\n        lattice_matrix = np.array(atoms.get_cell()) if atoms.pbc.all() else np.expand_dims(np.identity(3), axis=0)\n        cart_coords = atoms.get_positions()\n        if atoms.pbc.all():\n            src_id, dst_id, images, bond_dist = find_points_in_spheres(\n                cart_coords,\n                cart_coords,\n                r=self.cutoff,\n                pbc=pbc,\n                lattice=lattice_matrix,\n                tol=numerical_tol,\n            )\n            exclude_self = (src_id!= dst_id) | (bond_dist > numerical_tol)\n            src_id, dst_id, images, bond_dist = (\n                src_id[exclude_self],\n                dst_id[exclude_self],\n                images[exclude_self],\n```\n\n### Requirements:\n1.

The function uses the `find_points_in_spheres` function from `scipy.sparse` to find the points within a certain cutoff distance.\n2.

The `find_points_in_spheres` function returns the following values:\n    - `src_id`: The source indices of the edges.\n    - `dst_id`: The destination indices of the edges.\n    - `images`: The periodic images of the edges.\n    - `bond_dist`: The distances between the edges.\n4.
