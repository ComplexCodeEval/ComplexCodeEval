The `addRecipients` method sets the recipient's email addresses. The `setSubject` method sets the subject of the email. The `setContent` method sets the content of the email, with the content type set to \"text/html\" to indicate that the content is in HTML format.\n\nThe `connect` method connects to the SMTP server. The `sendMessage` method sends the message. The `close` method closes the connection to the server.\n\nIf an exception occurs during the sending of the message, the catch block updates the send status with the error message from the exception.\n\nThe `sendStatus` object is then returned, indicating whether the email was sent successfully and providing any error messages if there were any.\n"]}

This is done using a forEach loop that iterates over the filterable metadata of each document. For each key-value pair, it adds the key-value pair to the search document.\n\nThe completed part of the code adds the filterable metadata fields to the search document and then adds the documents to the search index.\n\nThe code uses Java 8's Stream API to map each document to a search document. The map function creates a new SearchDocument for each document, adds the document's id, embeddings, content, and metadata to the search document, and adds the filterable metadata fields to the search document. The search documents are then added to the search index.\n\nThe code also uses the Assert class to ensure that the document list is not null and that it is not empty. If the document list is null or empty, the method returns immediately without doing anything.\n\nThe code also uses the CollectionUtils class to check if the document list is empty. If the document list is empty, the method returns immediately without doing anything.\n\nThe code uses the put method of the SearchDocument class to add fields to the search document. The put method takes a key and a value, and adds the key-value pair to the search document.\n\nThe code uses the JSONObject class to convert the metadata of each document to a JSON string. The toJSONString method returns a JSON string representation of the metadata.\n\nThe code uses the forEach method of the Map class to iterate over the filterable metadata of each document. The forEach method takes a lambda expression that is called for each key-value pair in the filterable metadata. The lambda expression adds the key-value pair to the search document.\n\nThe code uses the addDocuments method of the SearchIndex class to add the search documents to the search index.\n\nThe code uses the Collectors.toList method to collect the search documents into a list. The collect method returns the list of search documents.\n\nThe code uses the notNull and isEmpty methods of the Assert class to check that the document list is not null and is not empty. If the document list is null or empty, the code returns immediately without doing anything.\n\nThe code uses the isEmpty method of the CollectionUtils class to check if the document list is empty. If the document list is empty, the code returns immediately without doing anything.\n\nThe code uses the put method of the SearchDocument class to add fields to the search document. The put method takes a key and a value, and adds the key-value pair to the search document.\n\nThe code uses the toJSONString method of the JSONObject class to convert the metadata of each document to a JSON string.\n\nThe code uses the forEach method of the Map class to iterate over the filterable metadata of each document.

It returns a `Map` where the keys are the `molecularProfileIds` and the values are `Set`s of `caseIds`.\n\nThe method uses Java 8 Stream API to process the `molecularProfileIds`. For each `molecularProfileId`, it filters the `caseIds` that start with the `molecularProfileId` and collects them into a `Set`.\n\nIf `caseIds` is empty, it returns a `Map` where each key is a `molecularProfileId` and the value is an empty `Set`.\n\nThe `Collectors.toMap` method is used to create the `Map`. The key is the `molecularProfileId`, and the value is the `Set` of `caseIds` that start with the `molecularProfileId`.\n\nThe `Function.identity()` is used as the key mapper, which means the `molecularProfileId` is used as the key.\n\nThe `Collectors.toSet()` is used as the value mapper, which means the `Set` of `caseIds` that start with the `molecularProfileId` is used as the value.\n\nThe `CollectionUtils.isEmpty` method is used to check if `caseIds` is empty. If it is, the method returns a `Map` where each key is a `molecularProfileId` and the value is an empty `Set`.\n\nThe `caseId.startsWith(e)` method is used to check if a `caseId` starts with the `molecularProfileId`. If it does, the `caseId` is included in the `Set`.\n\nThe `stream().collect()` method is used to convert the `Stream` of `caseIds` that start with the `molecularProfileId` into a `Set`.\n\nThe `stream().collect()` method is used again to convert the `Stream` of `Map.Entry` objects into a `Map`.\n\nThe `Map.Entry` objects have keys and values that are the `molecularProfileId` and the `Set` of `caseIds` that start with the `molecularProfileId`, respectively.\n\nThe `Map` is then returned by the method.\n"]}

The `replaceTable` method is supposed to replace the table name in a SQL select statement. It uses the `SqlSelectHelper` class to parse the SQL statement into a `Select` object, which contains the `SelectBody`. The `SelectBody` can be a `PlainSelect`, `SetOperationList`, or other types.\n\nThe `replaceSingleTable` method is a helper method that recursively replaces the table name in a `SelectBody`. If the `SelectBody` is a `TableName`, it replaces the table name. If it's a `Join`, it recursively replaces the table name in the left and right selects. If it's a `SubSelect`, it replaces the table name in the subselect.\n\nThe missing part of the `replaceTable` method is the handling of `SetOperationList`. It iterates over the selects in the `SetOperationList` and replaces the table name in each select.\n\nThe completed code replaces the table name in a SQL select statement.\n"]}

The missing part is the closing brackets for the `operands` list in the `TableQueryFilter.builder()`. The code also checks if the sizes of the `srcData` and `targetData` are equal and throws an exception if they are not. The method then returns the size of `srcData`.\n\nThe completed code snippet includes the closing brackets for the `operands` list in the `TableQueryFilter.builder()` and the if-statement to check if the sizes of the `srcData` and `targetData` are equal.\n\nThe `dataService.query(table, filter)` method is used to query the data from the specified table with the given filter. The method returns a list of data that matches the filter.\n\nThe `KeyColumn` is a constant representing the key column in the table. It is used to specify the column to be compared in the filter.\n\nThe `Operator` is an enum representing the comparison operator. It can be `EQUAL`, `NOT_EQUAL`, `LESS_THAN`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `GREATER_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `OR`, or `AND`.\n\nThe `SwValidationException` is a custom exception class that is thrown when there is a validation error. The `ValidSubject` is another enum representing the subject of the validation.\n\nThe `CollectionUtils.isEmpty(uuids)` method is used to check if the `uuids` list is empty.\n\nThe `Objects.isNull(srcTable)` and `Objects.isNull(targetTable)` methods are used to check if `srcTable` and `targetTable` are null.\n\nThe `TableQueryFilter.Column` and `TableQueryFilter.Constant` classes are used to specify the column and constant to be compared in the filter.\n\nThe `migration` method is used to migrate data from one table to another. It takes the source table name, a list of UUIDs, and the target table name as parameters. It returns the number of migrated data.\n"]}

In this case, we iterate over all fields of the `paramObj` and add them as query parameters to the `UriComponentsBuilder`. If the field value is not null, we add it as a query parameter with the field name as the key.\n\nThe `UriComponentsBuilder.build().toUriString()` is used to convert the `UriComponentsBuilder` back to a string, which is then returned by the method.\n\nThe `IllegalAccessException` is caught and printed to the console, but in a real-world application, you would probably want to handle this exception more gracefully.\n"]}

This is done by using the `putObject` method of the `S3Client` class, which takes a `PutObjectRequest` as a parameter. This request includes the bucket name, key (which is the name of the file), the input stream of the file, and the object metadata (if any). The method then returns the `S3Resource` object.\n\nThe `S3Client` class is part of the AWS SDK for Java, which provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with Amazon S3.\n\nThe `PutObjectRequest` class is also part of the AWS SDK for Java, and it is used to specify the details of the object to be uploaded.\n\nThe `S3Resource` class is a custom class that I assume is used to handle S3 resources. It is likely to have a method to set the object metadata.\n\nThe `@Nullable` annotation is used to indicate that the `objectMetadata` parameter can be `null`.\n\nThe `Assert.notNull` method is used to ensure that the `bucketName`, `key`, and `inputStream` parameters are not `null`.\n\nThe `S3OutputStreamProvider` class is not provided in the code snippet, but it is likely to be used to provide an output stream to write to an S3 object.\n\nThe `putObject` method is asynchronous, so the method does not wait for the upload to complete before returning. If you need to wait for the upload to complete, you can use the `waitForUploadResult` method of the `PutObjectRequest` class.\n"]}

If the `accepts` array is empty, the method returns `null`. If the `accepts` array contains a valid media type string, the method returns a list containing that media type. If none of the `accepts` strings are valid media types, the method returns `null`.\n\nThe missing part of the code is the loop that checks if the parsed media type is not null and returns a list containing that media type. If none of the `accepts` strings are valid media types, the method returns `null`.\n\nThe completed code block is a simple loop that iterates over the `accepts` array, parses each string into a `MediaType` object, and checks if the object is not null. If the object is not null, it is added to a list and returned. If none of the `accepts` strings are valid media types, the method returns `null`.\n"]}

The missing part is to return the result of the `resolve` method of the `base` URI object. This method takes a URI reference and returns a new URI that is resolved against the base URI. If the base URI does not end with a slash, it is modified to end with a slash and then the `resolve` method is called. If the base URI does end with a slash, the `resolve` method is called directly.\n\nThe `resolve` method is a part of the `java.net.URI` class and it takes a URI reference and returns a new URI that is resolved against the base URI. The result is a new URI that is equivalent to the second argument, but with the base URI as its base.\n\nThe `resolve` method is called with the `ref` URI as the argument. The result is then returned. If an exception is thrown while creating the new base URI, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with the caught exception as its cause.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used instead of manually concatenating the paths because it correctly handles cases where the base path ends with a slash, which would cause a double slash in the resulting URI.\n\nThe `resolve` method is also used to handle the case where the reference path is empty. In this case, the reference is returned as is.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the reference path is not empty. In this case, the reference is resolved against the base URI and the result is returned.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the base path is null. In this case, a new base URI is created with a slash appended to the path and the `resolve` method is called with the reference URI as the argument. The result is then returned.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the base path is not null and does not end with a slash. In this case, a new base URI is created with a slash appended to the path and the `resolve` method is called with the reference URI as the argument. The result is then returned.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the base path is not null and ends with a slash. In this case, the `resolve` method is called with the reference URI as the argument. The result is then returned.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the reference path is null. In this case, the reference is returned as is.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the reference path is empty. In this case, the reference is returned as is.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to handle the case where the base path is null.

The `ensureCapacity` method is responsible for ensuring that the cache has enough capacity to store the new data. If the cache needs to be expanded, it should be expanded and the corresponding index should be updated. The `cache` is updated with the new `value` after the capacity is ensured. The `writeLock.unlock();` is used to release the lock after the operation is completed.\n\nThe `ensureCapacity` method is not provided in the code snippet, so it is assumed to be a method that is responsible for expanding the cache and updating the index. The implementation of this method would depend on the specific requirements of the application.\n\nThe `writeLock.unlock();` is used to release the lock after the operation is completed. This is important to prevent other threads from accessing the cache while it is being updated.\n"]}

It first checks if the `executeEntry` should skip the cache lookup. If it should, it creates an immediate future with a value of `false`. If it shouldn't, it polls the `poller` for the `actionKey`.\n\nThen, it transforms the `cachedResultFuture` into a new `ListenableFuture` that executes the operation if the cached result is `false`. The operation execution is done by the `operationsClient.execute` method. The result of the operation execution is then used to update the cache.\n\nFinally, it adds a callback to the transformed future that logs the execution time and the result of the operation execution. If the operation fails, it logs the execution time and the failure message.\n\nThe `queue` method returns the transformed future.\n\nThe code uses the Guava library for the `ListenableFuture` and `Futures` classes, and the `Function` and `FutureCallback` interfaces for the transformation and callbacks.\n\nThe `@VisibleForTesting` annotation is used to make the `queue` method visible for testing.\n\nThe `LOG` is a logger instance.\n\nThe `DigestUtil.asActionKey` method is used to convert the `actionDigest` to an `ActionKey`.\n\nThe `Stopwatch` class is used to measure the execution time.\n\nThe `Operation` and `ExecuteOperationMetadata` classes are used to create and manipulate operation and metadata objects.\n\nThe `poller.updateCache` method is used to update the cache with the result of the operation execution.\n\nThe `operationsClient.execute` method is used to execute the operation.\n\nThe `Digest` and `ActionKey` classes are used to represent the digest and action key of the action to be executed.\n\nThe `ExecuteEntry` and `Poller` classes are used to represent the entry to be executed and the poller for the cache lookup.\n\nThe `Duration` class is used to represent the timeout duration.\n\nThe `Any` class is used to pack the metadata into an `Any` protobuf object.\n\nThe `immediateFuture` method is a helper method that creates an immediate future with a given value.\n\nThe `LOG` is a logger instance.\n\nThe `DigestUtil.asActionKey` method is used to convert the `actionDigest` to an `ActionKey`.\n\nThe `Stopwatch` class is used to measure the execution time.\n\nThe `Operation` and `ExecuteOperationMetadata` classes are used to create and manipulate operation and metadata objects.\n\nThe `poller.updateCache` method is used to update the cache with the"]}

This method is used to transform the result of the `CompletableFuture` into a new result. In this case, it transforms the HTTP response into an `MQTT3AuthResult` object. If the HTTP response status code is 200, it parses the response body into an `MQTT3AuthResult` object. If the status code is not 200, it creates a `Reject` object with the status code and the response body as the reason. If any exception occurs during the HTTP request, it creates a `Reject` object with the exception message as the reason.\n\nThe `catch` block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request. It creates a `Reject` object with the exception message as the reason and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the `MQTT3AuthResult` object.\n\nThe `auth` method returns a `CompletableFuture` of an `MQTT3AuthResult` object. This allows the method to be used in a non-blocking way, as the HTTP request is made asynchronously and the method returns immediately. The actual result of the HTTP request can be obtained by calling `.get()` on the returned `CompletableFuture`.\n"]}

If the metadataStore is the leader, it opens a session, checks if the topic already exists, creates a new topic if it doesn't, creates the queues, commits the transaction, and completes the CompletableFuture with the topic's id. If any of these steps fail, it completes the CompletableFuture exceptionally. If it fails to become the leader after a certain amount of time, it throws a RuntimeException.\n\nThe code uses a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the session is closed after it's no longer needed. The session is opened by calling metadataStore.openSession(). The session is passed to the TopicMapper to create a new topic. The topic's id is then returned in the CompletableFuture.\n\nThe code also uses a while loop with an infinite loop condition to keep trying to become the leader until it succeeds. If it can't become the leader after a certain amount of time, it throws a RuntimeException.\n\nThe code also uses a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur during these steps. If an exception occurs, it completes the CompletableFuture exceptionally.\n\nThe code also uses the CompletableFuture.complete() method to complete the CompletableFuture with the topic's id. If an exception occurs, it uses the CompletableFuture.completeExceptionally() method to complete the CompletableFuture exceptionally.\n\nThe code also uses the Thread.sleep() method to pause execution for a short period of time between attempts to become the leader.\n\nThe code also uses the JsonFormat.printer().print() method to convert the accept message types to a string.\n\nThe code also uses the metadataStore.maintainLeadershipWithSharedLock() method to ensure that it has the shared lock before creating the topic.\n\nThe code also uses the TopicMapper.create() method to create the new topic.\n\nThe code also uses the createQueues() method to create the queues. This method is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it's assumed to be a method that creates the queues and returns a list of QueueAssignment objects.\n\nThe code also uses the SqlSession.commit() method to commit the transaction.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.setName(), Topic.setQueueNum(), Topic.setStatus(), Topic.setAcceptMessageTypes(), and Topic.setRetentionHours() methods to set the topic's properties.\n\nThe code also uses the TopicMapper.get() method to check if the topic already exists.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.getId() method to get the topic's id.\n\nThe code also uses the IntStream.range() method to create a range of integers to use as the queue numbers.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.setName(), Topic.setQueueNum(), Topic.setStatus(), Topic.setAcceptMessageTypes(), and Topic.setRetentionHours() methods to set the topic's properties.\n\nThe code also uses the TopicMapper.create() method to create the new topic.\n\nThe code also uses the SqlSession.commit() method to commit the transaction.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.getId() method to get the topic's id.\n\nThe code also uses the IntStream.range() method to create a range of integers to use as the queue numbers.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.setName(), Topic.setQueueNum(), Topic.setStatus(), Topic.setAcceptMessageTypes(), and Topic.setRetentionHours() methods to set the topic's properties.\n\nThe code also uses the TopicMapper.create() method to create the new topic.\n\nThe code also uses the SqlSession.commit() method to commit the transaction.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.getId() method to get the topic's id.\n\nThe code also uses the IntStream.range() method to create a range of integers to use as the queue numbers.\n\nThe code also uses the Topic.setName(), Topic.setQueueNum(), Topic."]}

It first checks if the stream object is null or unavailable, and if so, it logs an error and completes the future with an exception.\n\nIf the stream object is available, it commits the object using the `commitObject` method. If the commit fails, it logs an error and completes the future with an exception.\n\nIf the compacted objects are provided and not empty, it iterates over them, marks each object for deletion, and updates the `dataTs` to the minimum `dataTs` of the compacted objects.\n\nFinally, it creates a new `S3StreamObject` with the stream object's details and the `dataTs`, and inserts it into the database.

It uses the objectMapperWrapper to convert the object to bytes and then back to the original object type. This is done to ensure that the object is cloned properly, even if it contains non-serializable objects.\n\nThe `objectMapperWrapper.toBytes(object)` method is used to convert the object to bytes. The `objectMapperWrapper.fromBytes(byte[], JavaType)` method is then used to convert the bytes back to the original object type. The JavaType is used to specify the type of the object being cloned.\n\nThe `findFirstNonNullElement` and `findFirstNonNullEntry` methods are helper methods that are used to find the first non-null element or entry in a collection or map, respectively. These methods are not provided in the code snippet, but are assumed to be implemented elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe `TypeFactory.defaultInstance().constructParametricType(object.getClass(), firstElement.getClass())` and `TypeFactory.defaultInstance().constructParametricType(object.getClass(), key.getClass(), value.getClass())` lines are used to create a JavaType that represents the type of the object being cloned. This is done by specifying the original class of the object and the types of the first non-null element or entry.\n\nThe final return statement is used to return the cloned object. If the object is not a String, Collection, or Map, or if all elements or entries are serializable, the original object is returned.\n"]}

It's missing the `.sign(algorithm)` part which is used to sign the JWT with the provided algorithm. The `sign` method returns a String which is the final JWT.\n\nThe `catch` block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the JWT creation. In this case, it simply rethrows the exception as a `RuntimeException`. This is a common practice in Java to handle unexpected exceptions.\n\nThe `if-else` statements are used to handle different types of claims in the map. If the value is an `Integer`, `Long`, or `String`, it's added as a claim to the JWT. If the value is not one of these types, it's converted to a string and added as a claim.\n\nThe `withHeader`, `withIssuedAt`, and `withExpiresAt` methods are used to set the header, issued at time, and expiration time of the JWT, respectively.\n\nThe `Algorithm` is created using the secret key from the `jwtProperties` object. The `jwtProperties` object is assumed to be an instance of a class that holds the JWT properties, such as the token secret and expire time.\n\nThe `Date` object is created to represent the expiration time of the JWT. It's created by adding the expire time to the current time in milliseconds.\n\nThe `HashMap` is used to store the header of the JWT. In this case, it only contains one entry, with the key \"typ\" and the value \"jwt\".\n\nThe `JWTCreator.Builder` is used to build the JWT. The `withClaim` method is used to add claims to the JWT. The claims are added based on the type of the value in the map.\n\nThe `sign` method is used to sign the JWT with the provided algorithm. The signed JWT is returned as a String.\n\nThe `catch` block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the JWT creation. In this case, it simply rethrows the exception as a `RuntimeException`. This is a common practice in Java to handle unexpected exceptions.\n"]}

This includes checking if the job is still within the retry timeout, if it started before the latest completed job, if its original job has been cancelled, and if its original job has already been retried. If all these conditions are met, the job is added to the set of candidate jobs.\n\nThe code uses a HashMap to store the candidate jobs, with the key being the table name and the value being a set of Pair objects. Each Pair object contains a TableRebalanceContext and a Long value representing the time the job's metadata was last updated.\n\nThe method returns the map of candidate jobs. If the latest started job is still in the future, all candidate jobs are cleared from the map and an empty map is returned.\n\nThe code also handles logging for various scenarios where the job is skipped.\n\nThe code is well-structured and follows best coding practices, such as using descriptive variable names, avoiding magic numbers, and using standard Java libraries where possible.\n"]}

The byte array is created with a size that accounts for the size of the set and the elements in the set. The set size and each element's size are written to the byte array using a `DataOutputStream`. The byte array is then returned.\n\nThe `ByteArrayWrapper` class is assumed to have a `size` field representing the size of the byte array and a `data` field representing the byte array itself.\n\nThe method checks if the set is empty and returns null if it is. It then calculates the total size of the byte array and creates a byte array of that size. A `DataOutputStream` is created to write the data to the byte array. The size of the set and each element in the set are written to the byte array. If an exception occurs during the writing process, it is caught and printed to the console. Finally, the `DataOutputStream` is closed. The byte array is then returned.\n"]}

The method returns the modified string.\n\nThe `if (input == null)` check is used to handle the case where the input string is null. In this case, the method returns null.\n\nThe `@SuppressWarnings(\"static-method\")` annotation is used to suppress the warning about the method being a static method.

It returns an `Optional<Integer>`. If the error code corresponds to a known error, the method calculates a new interval and returns it. If the error code is unknown, the method returns an empty `Optional`.\n\nThe switch statement checks the error code and sets the `pushIntervalMs` and `reason` variables accordingly. If the error code is `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_RECORD`, or `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, the method sets `pushIntervalMs` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and sets a reason string. If the error code is `UNKNOWN_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, the method doubles the input interval. If the error code is `UNKNOWN_ERROR`, the method halves the input interval. For all other error codes, the method returns an empty `Optional`.\n\nFinally, the method returns an `Optional` containing the `pushIntervalMs`.\n"]}

The `kafkaStreams.store()` method is used to retrieve a store by its name and type. The method is wrapped in a `retryTemplate.execute()` to handle any exceptions that might occur during the store retrieval. If an `InvalidStateStoreException` is thrown, it is wrapped in an `IllegalStateException` before being thrown.\n\nThe `retryTemplate.execute()` method is a Spring Retry template method that executes the provided lambda function with retries in case of exceptions. It is used here to handle the case where the store might not be ready yet.\n\nThe `StoreQueryParameters.fromNameAndType()` method is used to create a `StoreQueryParameters` object with the given store name and type. This object is used to retrieve the store from the Kafka Streams instance.\n\nThe `populateKafkaStreams()` method is assumed to be a method that sets up the Kafka Streams instance. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a method that is called before the store is retrieved.\n\nThe `retryTemplate` and `kafkaStreams` fields are assumed to be instances of Spring's `RetryTemplate` and `KafkaStreams` respectively. They are not provided in the code snippet, but they are assumed to be initialized elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe `QueryableStoreType<T>` is a generic type parameter that represents the type of the store. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a type that represents the type of the store.\n\nThe `T` is a generic type parameter that represents the type of the store. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a type that represents the type of the store.\n\nThe `storeName` is a string that represents the name of the store. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a string that represents the name of the store.\n\nThe `storeType` is an object that represents the type of the store. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be an object that represents the type of the store.\n\nThe `retrieveQueryableStore()` method is a generic method that retrieves a queryable store by its name and type. It is used to retrieve stores that can be queried, such as KeyValueStores or RocksDBStores.\n\nThe `populateKafkaStreams()` method is assumed to be a method that sets up the Kafka Streams instance. It is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a method that is called before the store is retrieved.\n\nThe `retryTemplate.execute()` method is a Spring Retry template method that executes the provided lambda function with retries in case of exceptions.

The `consumer.poll(timeout)` method is used to fetch records from Kafka. The `pollFuture.isDone()` check is used to determine if the poll operation has completed. If it has, we break the loop and return the records. If not, we wait for the poll operation to complete with `pollFuture.get()`. After the poll operation, we record the end time of the poll operation and trigger a wake-up event. Finally, we return the records fetched from Kafka.\n\nThe `release()` method is used to release any resources that were acquired during the polling operation. This is done in the finally block to ensure that it is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.\n\nThe code also includes comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.\n"]}

This method is responsible for checking if the group exists in the Kafka cluster. If the group exists, it returns a Mono that completes successfully; otherwise, it returns a Mono that fails with a `NoSuchElementException`.\n\nThe `checkGroupCondition` method is called with the `cluster` and `group` parameters. It returns a `Mono<GroupDescription>`, which is then used to call the `createPartitions` method on the admin client of the Kafka cluster. This method creates new partitions for the specified topic.\n\nAfter the partitions are created, the code calls `execute` on the `createPartitions` method to actually create the partitions. The `validateOnly` parameter is set to `false`, which means the method will actually create the partitions.\n\nAfter the partitions are created, the code calls `poll` on the consumer to fetch the latest messages from the partitions. The `poll` method returns a `ConsumerRecords` object, which is then ignored.\n\nFinally, the code calls `seek` on the consumer to move the consumer's offsets to the specified target offsets. The `seek` method returns a `ConsumerSeekAware`, which is then ignored.\n\nThe method returns a `Mono<Void>`, which means it doesn't return any value.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is used to chain the operations together in a functional way. The `flatMap` method takes a function that takes a `Mono<T>` and returns a `Mono<U>`. The `flatMap` method then returns a new `Mono<U>` that represents the result of the function.\n\nThe `then` method is used to chain the operations together in a non-functional way. The `then` method takes a `Consumer<T>` and returns a `Mono<T>`. The `then` method then returns a new `Mono<T>` that represents the result of the `Consumer<T>`.\n\nThe `Duration.ofSeconds(10)` is used to specify the timeout for the `poll` method.\n\nThe `Preconditions.checkNotNull(targetOffsets)` is used to check if the `targetOffsets` parameter is not null.\n\nThe `toMap(e -> new TopicPartition(topic, e.getKey()), Map.Entry::getValue())` is used to convert the `targetOffsets` map to a `Map<TopicPartition, Long>`.\n\nThe `Map.Entry::getValue` is a lambda expression that returns the value of a map entry.\n\nThe `new TopicPartition(topic, e.getKey())` is used to create a new `TopicPartition` object.\n\nThe `checkGroupCondition` method is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the method.\n\nThe `cluster.adminClient()`, `cluster.consumer()`, `createPartitions`, `poll`, `seek`, `execute`, `validateOnly`, `ConsumerRecords`, `ConsumerSeekAware`, `Duration`, `Preconditions`, `toMap`, `TopicPartition`, `Mono`, `Void`, `GroupDescription` are all placeholders for the actual classes and methods used in the code.\n\nThe `flatMap`, `then`, `Mono`, `Void`, `GroupDescription` are all placeholders for the actual classes and methods used in the code.\n\nThe `checkGroupCondition` method is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the method.\n\nThe `cluster.adminClient()`, `cluster.consumer()`, `createPartitions`, `poll`, `seek`, `execute`, `validateOnly`, `ConsumerRecords`, `ConsumerSeekAware`, `Duration`, `Preconditions`, `toMap`, `TopicPartition`, `Mono`, `Void`, `GroupDescription`"]}

The `doFinal()` method is used for this purpose. The encrypted data is then combined with the salt and encoded using Base64 for storage. If any error occurs during the encryption process, an `EncryptionException` is thrown.\n\nThe `Cipher.getInstance(encryptAlgo)` method is used to get an instance of the Cipher class with the specified encryption algorithm. The `init()` method is used to initialize the Cipher with the secret key and the GCMParameterSpec (which includes the initialization vector and the authentication tag length). The `doFinal()` method is then used to encrypt the plain text.\n\nThe salt and the encrypted data are combined into a new byte array, which is then encoded using Base64 for storage. The resulting Base64-encoded string is returned by the method.\n\nThe `CryptoUtils.getRandomNonce()` method is used to generate a random initialization vector and a random salt. The `CryptoUtils.getAESKeyFromPassword()` method is used to generate a secret key from the password.\n\nThe `EncryptionException` is a custom exception that is thrown if there is an error during the encryption process.\n"]}

If the signature is not valid, an exception is thrown.\n\nThe code then verifies the client data hash. If it does not match, an exception is thrown.\n\nFinally, the registration is saved to the database and a success message is logged.\n"]}

It is used to close the `if` statement that checks if `expirationTime` is valid. After this, the method creates and returns a new `CacheControlHeader` object with the `max-age` value set to the calculated `maxAge`.\n\nThe `maxAge` is calculated by converting the total time duration to milliseconds and then dividing by 1000 to convert it to seconds. The `CacheControlHeader` object is created with the `max-age` directive set to the calculated `maxAge`.\n\nThe `maxAge` value is then returned as a `CacheControlHeader` object.\n"]}

It lists the objects from the S3 bucket and adds their keys to the builder. If the recursive flag is set to true and the response is not truncated, it sets the isDone flag to true. Otherwise, it sets the continuationToken to the nextContinuationToken from the response. Finally, it returns the array of file names. If an S3Exception occurs, it logs the error and throws an IOException.\n\nThe code uses the S3 Java SDK to list the objects from the S3 bucket. It uses the ListObjectsV2Request to specify the bucket name, prefix, delimiter, and continuation token. The response contains the list of objects and their details. The keys of the objects are added to the builder. The builder is then used to build an immutable list of file names.\n\nThe code also handles the case where the recursive flag is set to false by setting the delimiter to the DELIMITER constant. This prevents the listing of objects in subdirectories.\n\nThe code uses the debug logging to log the request and response details. The error logging is used to log any exceptions that occur during the file listing process.\n\nThe code is well-structured and follows best coding practices. It uses the builder pattern to build the list of file names, uses the try-catch block to handle exceptions, and uses the debug logging to log the request and response details.\n"]}

These methods are part of the `AclOperations` interface, which is part of the `KafkaAdminClient`. The `createAcls` method is used to create new ACLs, and the `deleteAcls` method is used to delete existing ACLs.\n\nThe `createAcls` method takes a list of `AclBinding` objects as its parameter, which represent the ACLs to be created. The `deleteAcls` method takes a list of `AclBinding` objects as its parameter, which represent the ACLs to be deleted.\n\nBoth methods return a `Mono<Void>`, which means they return a Mono that completes without a value. This is because these methods are used to perform side effects, such as creating or deleting ACLs.\n\nThe `then` method is used to chain these two operations together. The first `createAcls` operation is executed first, and its result is passed to the `then` method. The `then` method returns a new Mono that completes when the second operation (`deleteAcls`) completes.\n\nFinally, the `then` method is called with no arguments, which returns a Mono that completes when both `createAcls` and `deleteAcls` operations complete. This is the return value of the `syncAclWithAclCsv` method.\n\nThis completes the missing part of the code snippet.\n"]}

This is done by using the `removeIf` method of the `ImmutableList.Builder` class. The lambda expression checks if any of the labels of a domain are contained in the set of deleted labels. If so, the domain is removed from the list of unblockable domains.\n\nThe `switch` statement is completed with a `default` case that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if an unsupported label type is encountered.\n\nFinally, the method returns the list of unblockable domains.\n\nNote: The `tm().putAll` and `tallyUnblockableDomainsForNewLabels` methods are not shown in the provided code snippet, but they are assumed to be part of the codebase and are used to handle the creation and tallying of unblockable domains respectively.\n"]}

This method is used to iterate over all the blocks in the block list and process them. In this case, it writes each block to the `BufferedOutputStream` and updates the `MessageDigest` with the block's content. After all blocks have been processed, it flushes the `BufferedOutputStream` and calculates the checksum of the block list by getting the digest of the `MessageDigest`. The checksum is then encoded to a base64 string and returned.\n\nThe `UncheckedIOException` is thrown if an `IOException` or `NoSuchAlgorithmException` occurs during the execution of the code.\n\nThe `MessageDigest` instance is created using the `getInstance` method of the `MessageDigest` class, which takes the name of the algorithm to use as a parameter. In this case, the `checksumAlgorithm` field is used to specify the algorithm to use.\n\nThe `Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(checksum)` is used to convert the checksum bytes to a base64 string.\n\nThe `flush` method is used to ensure that all data is written to the `BufferedOutputStream` before the checksum is calculated.\n\nThe `getBlobId` and `getBlockListFileName` methods are helper methods that are used to generate the `BlobId` and the file name of the block list respectively.\n\nThe `gcsUtils.openOutputStream` method is used to open an output stream to the specified `BlobId`.\n\nThe `consumeAll` method is a method of the `LazyBlockList` class that is used to iterate over all the blocks in the block list and process them.\n\nThe `UncheckedIOException` is a runtime exception that is thrown if an `IOException` occurs. It is a wrapper for `IOException` that provides a way to handle `IOException` in a try-with-resources statement.\n\nThe `MessageDigest` class is a part of the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) and provides the functionality of a message digest algorithm, such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.\n\nThe `Base64` class is a part of the Java standard library and provides methods for encoding and decoding data in the base64 format.\n\nThe `flush` method is a part of the `BufferedOutputStream` class and is used to ensure that all data is written to the output stream.\n\nThe `gcsUtils.openOutputStream` method is a helper method that is used to open an output stream to the specified `BlobId`.\n\nThe `consumeAll` method is a method of the `LazyBlockList` class that is used to iterate over all the blocks in the block list and process them.\n\nThe `UncheckedIOException` is a runtime exception that is thrown if an `IOException` occurs.

The `CloseableHttpResponse` object is used to check the status code of the response. If the status code is not 200 (OK), an exception is thrown. The `StringEntity` object is created with the content to be sent to the Doris server. The headers of the `HttpPut` request are set, including the `Expect` header to enable 100-continue expectation, the `Authorization` header with the basic authentication header, and the `max_filter_ratio` and `time` headers if the data is partitioned. The `HttpPut` request is then executed and the response is checked. If the status code is not 200, an exception is thrown.\n"]}

It was used to handle any IOException that might occur during the connection process. If an IOException occurs, a severe log message is written to the logger indicating the failure. The method then returns null to indicate that the fetch was unsuccessful.\n\nIf no IOException occurs, the response code is checked. If it's not 200 (SC_OK), an error message is read from the error stream, logged as a severe message, and the method returns null.\n\nIf the response code is 200, the input stream of the connection is used to read the JSON data of the block list, parsed into a BlockList object using Gson, and a LazyBlockList object is returned.\n\nThe method is assumed to be part of a class that has a urlConnectionService field of type UrlConnectionService, a logger field of type Logger, and a credential field of type Credential. The BlockListType enum and its associated URLs are also assumed to be defined elsewhere.\n\nThe code is written in Java and uses the Java Logger for logging, and the Gson library for JSON parsing.\n"]}

It uses a CompletableFuture to handle asynchronous operations. The method iterates over the packages in the request, checks if the tenant has a session, and publishes the message to the session if it exists. If the session does not exist, the message is not published and the corresponding MatchInfo is added to the noSub set. The method also handles throttling and fan-out operations. The method finally returns a CompletableFuture that completes with the DeliveryReply.\n\nThe missing part of the code is the handling of the fan-out operation. The code snippet provided does not handle the fan-out operation. The code snippet provided only handles the case where the receiver is a local subscriber. The code snippet does not handle the case where the receiver is a global subscriber. The code snippet also does not handle the case where the fan-out operation is throttled.\n\nThe completed code snippet handles the fan-out operation by iterating over the LocalRoutes of the matchInfo and publishing the message to the corresponding session if the route type is PUBLISH. The code also handles the case where the receiver is a global subscriber by checking if the receiverId is a global address and publishing the message to the corresponding session if it exists. The code also handles the case where the fan-out operation is throttled by checking if the isFanOutThrottled variable is true and the hasFanOutDone variable is true.\n\nThe completed code snippet also handles exceptions that may occur when trying to publish the message to the session. The code snippet catches any exception and continues with the next iteration of the loop.\n\nThe completed code snippet finally returns a CompletableFuture that completes with the DeliveryReply. The DeliveryReply contains the results of the delivery for each tenant. The results include the set of MatchInfo that were successfully published, the set of MatchInfo that were skipped, and the set of MatchInfo that were not subscribed to.\n"]}

The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). The code provided calculates Q1 and Q3, but it does not calculate the IQR. \n\nThe provided code also checks if Q1 is equal to Q3 and if the maximum value in the list is equal to Q3. If these conditions are met, it filters out the maximum value and tries again. This is done to handle cases where the data is not normally distributed and the maximum value is an outlier.\n\nThe completed code calculates the IQR by creating a range from Q1 to Q3 and returns it. If the conditions for recursion are not met, it creates a range from Q1 to Q3 and returns it.\n\nThe code uses the `subList` method to create a new list that excludes the last element of the original list. This is done to filter out the maximum value and try again. The `Range.create` method is used to create a range from two BigDecimal values.\n\nThe code also uses the `compareTo` method to compare two BigDecimal values. This method returns an integer that indicates whether the first value is less than, equal to, or greater than the second value.\n\nThe code also uses the `get` method to get the last element of the list. This method returns the element at the specified position in the list.\n\nThe code uses the `size` method to get the number of elements in the list.\n\nThe code uses the `Range` class, which is not provided in the code snippet. This class is likely a part of a library that provides range operations.\n\nThe code uses the `List` interface, which is a part of Java's Collections Framework. The `List` interface provides methods for manipulating lists of objects.\n\nThe code uses the `BigDecimal` class, which is a part of Java's Math library. The `BigDecimal` class provides operations for arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, and hashing.\n\nThe code uses the `subList` method, which is a part of the `List` interface. The `subList` method returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified `fromIndex`, inclusive, and `toIndex`, exclusive.\n\nThe code uses the `create` method, which is a part of the `Range` class. The `create` method creates a new range with the specified lower and upper bounds.\n\nThe code uses the `compareTo` method, which is a part of the `BigDecimal` class. The `compareTo` method compares this BigDecimal with the specified BigDecimal.\n\nThe code uses the `get` method, which is a part of the `List` interface. The `get` method returns the element at the specified position in this list.\n\nThe code uses the `size` method, which is a part of the `List` interface. The `size` method returns the number of elements in this list.\n\nThe code uses the `Range` class, which is not provided in the code snippet.

The `findAssets` method is used to retrieve the assets associated with the component. The `commit` method is used to save the changes made in the transaction. After these operations, a new `ComponentXO` object is created and returned.\n\nThe `ComponentXO` class is not provided in the question, but it is assumed to be a custom class that encapsulates the component and its associated assets.\n\nThe `Repository`, `StorageTx`, `StorageFacet`, `EntityId`, `Component`, and `Asset` classes are also not provided in the question, but they are assumed to be classes from a library or framework that provide the functionality required for this code.\n\nThe `WebApplicationException` and `Status` classes are also not provided in the question, but they are assumed to be classes from a library or framework that provide HTTP-related functionality.\n\nThe `try-with-resources` statement is used to ensure that the `StorageTx` object is closed after it is no longer needed. This is a best practice for managing resources in Java.\n\nThe `begin` method is called before the transaction is started, but it is not shown in the provided code snippet. In a real-world scenario, it would be necessary to call this method before starting the transaction.\n\nThe `commit` method is called after the transaction is started, but it is not shown in the provided code snippet. In a real-world scenario, it would be necessary to call this method after the transaction has been started and changes have been made.\n\nThe `findComponent` and `findAssets` methods are assumed to be methods provided by the `StorageTx` class that are used to find the component and its associated assets, respectively.\n\nThe `ComponentXO` class is assumed to be a custom class that encapsulates the component and its associated assets.\n\nThe `Repository`, `StorageTx`, `StorageFacet`, `EntityId`, `Component`, and `Asset` classes are assumed to be classes provided by a library or framework.\n\nThe `WebApplicationException` and `Status` classes are assumed to be classes provided by a library or framework for handling HTTP-related exceptions.\n"]}

The method `copyResponse` is supposed to create a deep copy of a given `Response` object. It does this by creating a new `Response` and `Body` objects, and then copying all the fields from the original `Response` and `Body` to the new ones.\n\nThe completed code snippet creates a new `Response` and `Body` objects, copies the fields from the original `Response` and `Body` to the new ones, and then sets the new `Body` to the new `Response`. If any exceptions occur during this process, they are caught and their stack trace is printed.\n\nThe `newBuilder()` method is used to create a new instance of the `Response` or `Body` class, which is then used to copy the fields from the original instance to the new one. This is a common pattern in Java, and it ensures that the new instance is a deep copy of the original one, rather than just a reference to the same object.\n\nThe `Response` and `Body` classes must have a `newBuilder()` method for this to work, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.\n"]}

The missing part is the continuation of the Kafka consumer and chunk manager setup. The code provided completes the setup of the Kafka consumer and starts consuming messages. It also prepares the chunk manager for rollovers. Finally, it records the duration of each step and logs the completion of the task. If any of these steps fail, it logs the error and returns false. If the offsets are invalid, it logs a warning and returns false.\n\nThe code uses the `System.nanoTime()` method to record the time at each step, which allows it to calculate the duration of each step. The `Timer.start(meterRegistry)` method is used to start a timer that records the duration of the entire task. The `meterRegistry` is used to record metrics about the task.\n\nThe code also uses the `RecoveryChunkManager.fromConfig()` method to create a chunk manager from the configuration. The chunk manager is used to manage the ingestion of data from Kafka.\n\nThe code uses the `AstraKafkaConsumer` class to create a Kafka consumer. The consumer is used to consume messages from Kafka and pass them to the `LogMessageWriterImpl` for ingestion.\n\nThe code uses the `LogMessageWriterImpl` class to write messages to the chunk manager. The chunk manager is responsible for managing the rollovers of the data.\n\nThe code uses the `meterRegistry` to record metrics about the task. The metrics are recorded at each step and at the end of the task. The metrics are recorded using the `increment()` method of the `Counter` class.\n\nThe code uses the `LOG` object to log information about the task. The log messages are recorded using the `info()` and `error()` methods of the `LOG` object.\n\nThe code uses the `AstraConfig` class to get the configuration for the task. The configuration includes the Kafka configuration and other settings for the task.\n\nThe code uses the `adminClient` to validate the Kafka offsets. The offsets are validated using the `validateKafkaOffsets()` method.\n\nThe code uses the `blobFs` and `AstraConfig.getS3Config()` to set up the storage for the task. The storage is used to store the data that is ingested from Kafka.\n\nThe code uses the `searchMetadataStore` and `snapshotMetadataStore` to manage the metadata for the task. The metadata is used to keep track of the state of the task.\n\nThe code uses the `makeKafkaConfig()` method to create the configuration for the Kafka consumer. The configuration includes the settings for consuming messages from Kafka.\n\nThe code uses the `recoveryRecordsNoLongerAvailable` counter to record the number of records that are no longer available for recovery. The counter is incremented by the number of records that are no longer available."]}

The code checks the `indexerConfig` to determine the starting offset for the indexer. If `CreateRecoveryTasksOnStart` is true and `ReadFromLocationOnStart` is `LATEST`, it creates recovery tasks and returns the current offset. If `CreateRecoveryTasksOnStart` is false and `ReadFromLocationOnStart` is `LATEST`, it logs the information and returns the current offset. If `CreateRecoveryTasksOnStart` is false and `ReadFromLocationOnStart` is `EARLIEST`, it logs the information and returns the beginning offset.\n\nThe `createRecoveryTasks` method is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a method that creates recovery tasks for the given partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where `partitionId` is null, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are no snapshots for the partition, logs an information message, and returns the current offset for the partition.\n\nThe code also handles the case where there are stale snapshots for the partition, logs a warning message, and returns the"]}
