The method also includes a finally block to ensure that the transport is closed if it was opened.\n\nThe method uses the `javax.mail.Transport` class to send the email, and the `javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage` class to create the message. The `javax.mail.Session` class is used to set up the mail session.\n\nThe method also uses the `org.jsoup.Jsoup` class to parse the HTML template and replace placeholders with the provided username, agent name, and mail content. The `org.apache.commons.collections.CollectionUtils` class is used to check if the recipient list is empty.\n\nThe method returns a `SendStatus` object indicating the success or failure of the email sending process. If the mail is sent successfully, the status of the `SendStatus` is set to true. If an exception occurs during the process, the error message of the `SendStatus` is set to the exception message.\n\nThe method also includes a debug statement to enable debug output. This can be removed or modified as needed.\n\nThe method assumes that the `checkNotInBlacklistAddress` method is implemented elsewhere in the code and takes a list of email addresses and a `SendStatus` object as parameters. This method should check if any of the email addresses are in the blacklist and return a list of email addresses that are not in the blacklist. If any email addresses are in the blacklist, the `SendStatus` object's status is set to false and an error message is set.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `readHtmlToString` method is implemented elsewhere in the code and takes a file name as a parameter. This method should read the HTML file and return its content as a string.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `SEND_STATUS_TRUE` and `SEND_STATUS_FALSE` constants are defined elsewhere in the code. These constants should be defined as boolean values representing the status of the email sending process.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `SendStatus` class is a custom class that represents the status of the email sending process. This class should have a constructor that takes a status and an error message, and methods to get and set these values.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `Message.RecipientType.TO` constant is defined elsewhere in the code. This constant should be defined as an integer representing the recipient type.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `InternetAddress` class is defined elsewhere in the code. This class should be used to create email addresses.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage` class is defined elsewhere in the code. This class should be used to create the email message.\n\nThe method also assumes that the `javax.mail.Session` class is defined elsewhere in the code. This class should be used to set"]}

If the `caseIds` list is empty, it creates a map with keys as molecular profile IDs and empty sets as values. If `caseIds` is not empty, it maps each molecular profile ID to a set of case IDs. The set of case IDs is created by transforming the `caseIds` list into a stream and collecting it into a set.\n\nThe `Collectors.toMap` method is used to create a map. The `Function.identity()` function is used as the key mapper, which means that the keys in the resulting map are the same as the elements in the input list. The value mapper is a lambda expression that creates a set of case IDs for each molecular profile ID. The `caseIds.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet())` expression transforms the `caseIds` list into a stream, collects it into a set, and returns this set as the value for each molecular profile ID in the resulting map.\n\nThe `CollectionUtils.isEmpty` method is used to check if the `caseIds` list is empty. If it is, the method returns a map with keys as molecular profile IDs and empty sets as values.\n\nThe `stream()` method is used to convert the `molecularProfileIds` list into a stream, and the `collect()` method is used to collect the stream elements into a map.\n\nThe `Function.identity()` method is used as the key mapper in the `collect()` method, which means that the keys in the resulting map are the same as the elements in the input list. The value mapper is a lambda expression that creates an empty set for each molecular profile ID.\n\nThe `stream()` method is used again to convert the `caseIds` list into a stream, and the `collect()` method is used to collect the stream elements into a set. This set is then used as the value for each molecular profile ID in the resulting map.\n\nThe `Collectors.toSet()` method is used to collect the stream elements into a set.\n\nThe `stream()` method is used to convert the `molecularProfileIds` list into a stream, and the `collect()` method is used to collect the stream elements into a map.

The code first opens a connection to the URL using the provided path. It then sets the request method to GET, sets the connection and read timeouts, and adds any provided headers. It reads the response from the server and checks if the response code is 200 (indicating a successful request) and if the response body is not empty. If both conditions are met, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. If an IOException occurs during the request, it is thrown as a RuntimeException. Finally, the connection is closed regardless of whether an exception was thrown.\n"]}

If the `SelectBody` is a `TableName`, it sets the table name to the provided `tableName`. If it's a `Join`, it recursively replaces the table name in the right item.\n\nThe `replaceTable` method first checks if the `tableName` is empty. If it is, it returns the original `sql`. Then it gets the `Select` object from the `sql` using `SqlSelectHelper.getSelect(sql)`. It gets the `SelectBody` from the `Select` object. If the `SelectBody` is a `PlainSelect`, it calls `replaceSingleTable` to replace the table name in it. If it's a `SetOperationList`, it iterates over the `Select` objects in the `SetOperationList` and calls `replaceSingleTable` on each one. Finally, it returns the modified `sql`.\n\nThis code assumes that the `SqlSelectHelper` class has a `getSelect` method that takes a `String` and returns a `Select` object, and that the `Select`, `SelectBody`, `PlainSelect`, `SetOperationList`, `TableName`, and `Join` classes have the appropriate methods for getting and setting the table name.\n"]}

The `Collectors.toList()` method is used to convert the stream of filters into a list.\n\nThe `migrate(srcTable, filter, targetTable)` method is used to perform the actual migration. It returns the result of the migration operation.\n\nThe `CollectionUtils.isEmpty(uuids)` method is used to check if the UUIDs list is empty. If it is, a `SwValidationException` is thrown.\n\nThe `Objects.isNull(srcTable) || Objects.isNull(targetTable)` check is used to ensure that the source table and target table are not null. If either is null, a `SwValidationException` is thrown.\n\nThe `ValidSubject.EVALUATION` is a placeholder for the actual subject of the validation.

These methods are used to check if a column exists, if a column is a key, get the value of a column, get the tables after a regex filter, and check if a table is approved for truncation, respectively.\n\nThe `checkTablesWithFilter` method first checks if the name filter is empty. If it is, it sets the name filter to `MATCH_ALL_FILTER`. It then gets the tables that match the filter and the approved truncate tables. It then iterates over the tables, creating a `TableCheckVo` for each one. It checks if the table has a standard on update column, and if it does, it checks if the column is a key. If it is not, it sets the appropriate flags in the `TableCheckVo`. It then checks if the table is approved for truncation and adds the `TableCheckVo` to the list. Finally, it returns the list of `TableCheckVo`s.\n\nThe `TableCheckVo` class is assumed to have methods for setting the appropriate flags based on the checks performed.\n\nThe `isColumn`, `isKey`, `getColumn`, `getTablesAfterRegexFilter`, and `checkApprovedTruncateTableList` methods are not provided in the code snippet, so they need to be implemented.\n"]}

It first checks if the `text` is null or empty using the `Assert.hasText` method. If the `text` is null or empty, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message \"The text can not be null or empty.\".\n\nIf the `text` is not null or empty, it creates a `HttpHeaders` object and sets the \"Authorization\" header to the API key. It then creates an `HttpEntity` object with the `text` and `headers`.\n\nNext, it creates a `RestTemplate` object and uses it to send a POST request to the `embeddingModelUrl` with the `HttpEntity` as the request body. The response is returned as a `ResponseEntity<EmbeddingResponse>`.\n\nThe method then retrieves the body of the response and checks if it is null. If it is null, the method returns null. If it is not null, the method returns the `embedding` field of the `EmbeddingResponse` object.\n\nThe `EmbeddingResponse` record is a record class that represents the response from the embedding model. It has a single field, `embedding`, which is the embedding of the text.\n\nThe `@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)` annotation on the `EmbeddingResponse` record means that only non-null fields will be included in the JSON representation of the object.\n\nThe `embedText` method returns an `Embedding` object, which represents the embedding of the text.\n"]}

If the tracer attribute does not exist, a new `ApolloAuditTracer` is created and set in the request attributes. The method then returns the `ApolloAuditTracer`.\n\nThe `RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes()` method is used to get the current request attributes.

If the tracer attribute does not exist, the method returns null.\n\nThe `requestAttributes.setAttribute()` method is used to set the tracer attribute in the request attributes.

The method then returns the `S3Resource` object representing the uploaded object.\n\nThe `PutObjectRequest` constructor takes the bucket name, key, and input stream as parameters. The optional `ObjectMetadata` object is also passed to the constructor.\n\nThe `S3Client.putObject` method is used to upload the object to S3. This method is asynchronous and returns a `PutObjectRequest` object. The `S3Resource` object is then returned by the method.\n\nThe `S3Resource` object is created with the bucket name, key, and `S3Client` and `S3OutputStreamProvider` objects. The `S3Resource` object is used to represent the uploaded object in the S3 bucket.\n\nThe `S3Resource` object's `setObjectMetadata` method is called if an `ObjectMetadata` object is provided. This method sets the metadata for the uploaded object.\n\nThe `Assert.notNull` method is used to ensure that the required parameters (bucketName, key, inputStream) are not null. If any of these parameters are null, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nThe `S3Client.putObject` method is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the upload process. If an exception is thrown, a `S3Exception` is thrown.\n"]}

For each `accept`, it parses it into a `MediaType` object. If the `MediaType` is of type \"application\" and subtype \"json\" and does not have a parameter \"problem\", it returns a singleton list containing this `MediaType`. If no such `MediaType` is found after iterating over all `accepts`, it converts the `accepts` array into a `Stream`, maps each `accept` to a `MediaType`, and collects them into a list.\n\nThe `MediaType.parseMediaType(String)` method is used to parse the `accept` string into a `MediaType` object. The `MediaType.getType()` and `MediaType.getSubtype()` methods are used to get the type and subtype of the `MediaType`, respectively. The `MediaType.getParameters()` method returns a map of parameters of the `MediaType`, and the `containsKey(\"problem\")` method checks if this map contains a key \"problem\".\n\nThe `Collections.singletonList(Object)` method is used to create a list containing a single element, and the `Arrays.stream(T[])` method is used to convert the `accepts` array into a `Stream`. The `Stream.map(Function)` method is used to transform each `accept` into a `MediaType`, and the `Stream.collect(Collector)` method is used to collect the transformed `MediaType`s into a list.\n\nThe `Stream` operations are lazy, meaning they are only executed when the terminal operation (`collect` in this case) is invoked. This allows for efficient processing of large amounts of data.\n"]}

The missing part is the transaction synchronization code that sends a message after the transaction is committed. This code uses the `TransactionSynchronizationManager` to register a `TransactionSynchronization` that sends a message after the transaction is committed. The `afterCompletion` method is called by the transaction manager after the transaction is completed. If the transaction status is `TransactionStatus.COMMITTED`, then the message is sent.\n\nThe `TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronization` method is used to register a `TransactionSynchronization` that will be called at the end of the transaction. The `TransactionSynchronizationAdapter` is a convenience class that provides empty implementations of all methods, so you only need to override the ones you're interested in.\n\nIn this case, the `afterCompletion` method is overridden to send a message after the transaction is committed. The message sending code is not provided in the question, so it is left as a comment.\n\nThe code snippet provided is complete and should work as expected.\n"]}

It includes the response body parsing, setting the response code and message, and finally the request cancellation. The `parseResponse` method is a placeholder for the actual response parsing logic, which is not provided in the original code snippet.\n\nThe `EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` is used to get the response body as a string. The `response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode()` is used to get the status code of the response. If the status code is not 200 (which means the request is successful), the response code is set to `FAIL` and the message is set to the status code.\n\nThe `httpContext.getAttribute(HttpClientContext.HTTP_REQ_TARGET)` is used to check if the request was successfully created.

If the JSON object is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. Then, the \"keys\" field of the JSON object is fetched and returned as a string.\n\nThe `publicKeyCache` is a list of RSAKey objects that is initialized as an empty list in the `init()` method.\n\nThe `init()` method is assumed to be a public method.\n\nThe `publicKeyUri` is a string that represents the URI of the public keys.

The data is written to the cache using the `writeBytes` method of the `ByteBuf` class, which writes the bytes from the given `ByteBuf` into this buffer. The `release` method is called on the `data` `ByteBuf` to release its resources. The writeLock is unlocked in the finally block to ensure it is always unlocked, even if an exception is thrown.\n\nThe `ByteBuf` `newData` is created from the `value.blocks` array using the `wrappedBuffer` method of the `Unpooled` class. This `ByteBuf` is then written with the data from the `data` `ByteBuf` using the `writeBytes` method. The `data` `ByteBuf` is released to free its resources.\n\nThe `cache.put` and `lruCache.put` methods are used to put the new value into the cache and the LRU cache, respectively. The `put` method of the `NavigableMap` interface is used to put the new value into the cache, with the cache start position as the key and the new value as the value. The `put` method of the `LRUCache` class is used to put the new value into the LRU cache, with the cache start position as the key and the new value as the value.\n\nThe `ensureCapacity` method is not provided in the original code snippet, but it is assumed to be a method that ensures that the cache has enough capacity for the new data. This method is not included in the completed code.\n\nThe `Value` class is not provided in the original code snippet, but it is assumed to be a class that represents a value in the cache. This class is not included in the completed code.\n\nThe `Value` class should have a constructor that takes an array of integers (blocks) and an integer (dataLength) and creates a new `Value` object with these values. The `EMPTY` value is also assumed to be a `Value` object with an empty array of blocks and a data length of 0.\n\nThe `writeLock` is assumed to be a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object that is used to synchronize access to the cache. The `lock` and `unlock` methods of the `ReentrantReadWriteLock.Lock` interface are used to lock and unlock the writeLock, respectively.\n\nThe `blockSize` is assumed to be an integer that represents the size of a block in the cache.\n\nThe `lruCache` is assumed to be an `LRUCache` object that is used to store the most recently used values in the cache.\n\nThe `path2cache` is assumed to be a `ConcurrentHashMap` object that is used to map paths to caches. The `computeIfAbsent` method of the `ConcurrentHashMap` class is used to compute the cache for the given path if it doesn't exist.\n\nThe `Map.Entry` class is used to represent an entry in the cache. The `floorEntry` method of the `NavigableMap` interface is used to find the floor entry of the position in the cache.\n\nThe `System.arraycopy` method is used to copy the blocks from the old value to the new value.\n\nThe `Unpooled` class is used to create `ByteBuf` instances. The `wrappedBuffer` method of the `Unpooled` class is used to create a `ByteBuf` that wraps an existing array.\n\nThe `readableBytes` method of the `ByteBuf` class is used to get the number of readable bytes in the `ByteBuf`.\n\nThe `writeBytes` method of the `ByteBuf` class is used to write the bytes from the given `ByteBuf` into this buffer.\n\nThe `release` method of the `ByteBuf` class is used to release the resources of the `ByteBuf`.\n\nThe `put` method of the `LRUCache` class is used to put the new value into the LRU cache.\n\n"]}

The size of the log event is calculated and set in the log event header.\n\nThe payload bytes are then written into the payload buffer and the buffer is skipped by the payload length. The final buffer is then set as the buffer of the log event.\n\nThe `PooledByteBufAllocator.DEFAULT.directBuffer` is used to allocate a direct buffer, which is more efficient for large amounts of data. The direct buffer is created with a size that includes the header size and the payload length. The header is written into the buffer, followed by the payload. The payload length is then skipped.\n\nThe final buffer is then set as the buffer of the log event.\n\nThe `writeBytes` method is used to write the bytes of the payload and header into the buffer. The `skipBytes` method is used to skip the payload length bytes.\n\nThe `setSchemaName`, `setNextTransactionOffset`, `setPayloadLength`, and `toBytes` methods are presumably methods of the `logEventHeader` object. The `setSchemaName` and `setNextTransactionOffset` methods set the schema name and next transaction offset of the header, the `setPayloadLength` method sets the payload length of the header, and the `toBytes` method converts the header to a byte array.\n\nThe `ByteBuf` class is a Netty's byte buffer class, which provides a number of methods for reading and writing bytes.\n\nThe `PooledByteBufAllocator` class is a byte buffer allocator that uses a pool of byte buffers. This can be more efficient than creating new byte buffers for each operation.\n\nThe `HEADER_SIZE` is presumably the size of the log event header in bytes.\n\nThe `UNKNOWN` is the default value for the schema name if it is null.\n\nThe `payloadToBytes` method is presumably a method that converts the payload of the log event to a byte array.\n\nThe `buffer` field is presumably the buffer of the log event.\n\nThe `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object.\n\nThe `final` keyword is used to declare a variable as a constant.\n\nThe `int` and `long` data types are used to declare integer and long variables, respectively.\n\nThe `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true.\n\nThe `==` operator is used to compare two values for equality.\n\nThe `=` operator is used to assign a value to a variable.\n\nThe `final` keyword is used to declare a variable as a constant.\n\nThe `PooledByteBufAllocator` class is a byte buffer allocator that uses a pool of byte buffers.

The missing part of the method is completed in the provided code. The method retains the key prefix of a given tenant namespace and topic filter levels. It iterates over the topic filter levels and checks for wildcards. If a wildcard is found, it increments the `leastLevels` variable. If a single level wildcard is found, it sets the `singleLevelWildcard` variable to true. If the `leastLevels` variable is greater than 0, it concatenates the substring of the tenant namespace up to the `leastLevels` to the prefix. If a single level wildcard is found, it concatenates the tenant namespace to the prefix. If the topic filter level is not the last one, it adds a slash to the prefix. Finally, it returns the prefix.\n\nThe provided code snippet is syntactically correct and follows best coding practices. It uses the `ByteString` class to handle byte strings, and the `List` interface to handle the topic filter levels. It also uses the `concat` method to concatenate byte strings, and the `substring` method to get a substring of the tenant namespace.\n\nThe provided code snippet is logically correct. It correctly handles the wildcards and concatenates the correct parts of the tenant namespace to the prefix. It also correctly handles the case where a single level wildcard is found.\n\nThe provided code snippet is formatted using Markdown code block syntax. It is easy to read and understand. It is also formatted correctly according to the Java language syntax and conventions.\n\nThe provided code snippet does not include any additional text. It is a complete implementation of the method.\n"]}

If an exception is caught, a message is printed to the console and the method returns a CompletableFuture with a null value. The method also includes a check to see if the response status code is 200, and if it is, the response body is parsed into a MQTT3AuthResult. If the status code is not 200, a MQTT3AuthResult with a reject reason is returned.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 CompletableFuture API to handle the asynchronous HTTP request. The `httpClient.sendAsync` method is used to send the request and `thenApply` is used to handle the response. The response is parsed into a MQTT3AuthResult using the Jackson JSON library.\n\nThe method also uses the Java 8 Duration API to set a timeout of 5 seconds for the request.\n\nThe method is marked as `@Override` to indicate that it overrides a method in the superclass. The method is public to allow it to be accessed from other classes. The method is static to indicate that it does not depend on any instance variables of the class. The method is final to indicate that it cannot be overridden by subclasses.\n\nThe method is synchronous because it returns a CompletableFuture. This means that the method will not return until the CompletableFuture is completed. This is useful for non-blocking I/O operations.\n\nThe method is named `auth` because it is used for authentication. The method takes a single parameter of type MQTT3AuthData and returns a CompletableFuture of type MQTT3AuthResult.\n\nThe method uses the Jackson JSON library to convert the MQTT3AuthData and MQTT3AuthResult objects to and from JSON. The `JsonFormat.printer().print(authData)` and `JsonFormat.parser().merge(response.body(), resultBuilder)` lines do this.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 HttpClient API to send the HTTP request. The `HttpRequest.newBuilder()` method is used to create the request, and the `httpClient.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())` method is used to send the request and get the response.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 Stream API to handle the response. The `response.body().lines()` method is used to get the lines of the response body, and the `map` method is used to convert each line to a MQTT3AuthResult. The `collect` method is used to collect the results into a List.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 Optional API to handle the case where the response body is empty. The `Optional.ofNullable(response.body())` method is used to create an Optional from the response body, and the `orElseThrow` method is used to throw an exception if the Optional is empty.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 DateTime API to handle the date and time. The `LocalDateTime.now()` method is used to get the current date and time, and the `DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\")` method is used to format the date and time.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 Files API to handle the file. The `Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(fileName))` method is used to read all lines from the file, and the `Files.write(Paths.get(fileName), lines)` method is used to write the lines to the file.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 Collections API to handle the collection. The `Collections.sort(lines)` method is used to sort the lines, and the `Collections.reverse(lines)` method is used to reverse the lines.\n\nThe method uses the Java 8 Stream API to handle the stream. The `Stream."]}

If it is, it creates a new topic in the metadata store. If it is not, it forwards the request to the leader node. The method uses the API of `com.google.protobuf.util.JsonFormat.printer` to convert the accept types to a string format. The method returns a `CompletableFuture` that will be completed with the topic ID if the operation is successful, or an exception if the operation fails.\n\nThe missing part of the method is the part where the queues are created and the transaction is committed. This is done in the `try` block. If an exception occurs during the creation of the queues, the method completes the `CompletableFuture` with the exception. If the queues are successfully created, the method completes the `CompletableFuture` with the topic ID.\n\nIf the current node is not the leader, the method forwards the request to the leader node by calling `metadataStore.forwardToLeader(request)`. The return type of this method is `CompletableFuture<Long>`, so the method returns this value directly.\n\nThe `for (; ; )` loop is used to keep the method running until it completes. This is not a good practice in real-world applications, but it is used here for simplicity. In a real-world application, you would want to handle the case where the method could potentially run forever.\n\nThe `try-with-resources` statement is used to ensure that the `SqlSession` is closed after it is no longer needed. This is a good practice because it ensures that resources are properly released, even if an exception is thrown.\n\nThe `session.commit()` call is used to commit the transaction. This is necessary because the changes made in the transaction are not visible to other transactions until they are committed.\n\nThe `future.complete(topicId)` call is used to complete the `CompletableFuture` with the topic ID. This is done after the transaction is committed.\n\nThe `future.completeExceptionally(e)` call is used to complete the `CompletableFuture` with an exception if an exception occurs during the creation of the queues. This is done after the transaction is committed.\n\nThe `session.getMapper(TopicMapper.class)` call is used to get an instance of the `TopicMapper` interface. This interface provides methods for interacting with the topic data in the database.\n\nThe `topicMapper.get(null, request.getTopic())` call is used to check if a topic with the same name already exists. If a topic with the same name exists, an exception is thrown.\n\nThe `topicMapper.create(topic)` call is used to create a new topic in the database.\n\nThe `createQueues(IntStream.range(0, request.getCount()), topicId, session)` call is used to create the queues for the topic. This method is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a method that creates the queues and returns a list of `QueueAssignment` objects.\n\nThe `session.commit()` call is used to commit the transaction after the queues are created. This is necessary because the changes made in the transaction are not visible to other transactions until they are committed.\n\nThe `future.complete(topicId)` call is used to complete the `CompletableFuture` with the topic ID after the queues are created and the transaction is committed.\n\nThe `future.completeExceptionally(e)` call is used to complete the `CompletableFuture` with an exception if an exception occurs during the creation of the queues. This is done after the transaction is committed.\n\nThe `metadataStore.isLeader()` call is used to check if the current node is the leader.\n\nThe `metadataStore.openSession()` call is used to open a new `SqlSession`.\n\nThe `metadataStore.maintainLeadershipWithSharedLock(session)` call is used to maintain leadership with a shared lock. This is done before the queues are created.\n\nThe `session.getMapper("]}

It first checks if the stream object is ready for commit and if the objectId is available. If not, it throws a ControllerException. Then it commits the object and marks the compacted objects for deletion. The dataTs is updated to the min compacted object's dataTs. Finally, it inserts the stream object into the database and commits the session. If an exception occurs during the commit operation, it rolls back the session.\n\n### Note:\nThe provided code snippet is incomplete.

The aggregation is set to calculate the distinct count of the specified field. The result is then parsed and returned as an Optional Long. If an error occurs during the process, an empty Optional is returned.\n\nThe `SearchRequest` is created with the index alias and a `SearchSourceBuilder` is used to specify the query (match all), the size of the result set (0), and the aggregation. The aggregation is set to calculate the distinct count of the specified field using the `cardinality` method.\n\nThe result of the search is then retrieved and parsed to get the distinct count. This count is then wrapped in an Optional and returned. If an error occurs during the search, an error message is logged and an empty Optional is returned.\n\nThe `client.search(searchRequest)` method is used to execute the search request and return the search response. The `getAggregations()` method is used to get the aggregations from the search response, and the `getBuckets().size()` method is used to get the number of buckets (which represents the distinct count of the field).\n\nThe `ParsedLongTerms` class is used to parse the aggregation response. The `getBuckets()` method is used to get the buckets from the parsed response, and the size of the buckets list represents the distinct count of the field.\n\nThe `IOException` is caught and logged, and an empty Optional is returned to indicate that an error occurred.\n"]}

The code checks the status of each job and decides whether to skip it, add it to the candidates map, or clear the candidates map. The candidates map contains pairs of TableRebalanceContext and start time in milliseconds for each job that is not completed, not running, and not cancelled. The map is cleared if the latest started job is completed after the latest completed job.\n\nThe code uses the `RebalanceResult.Status` enum to determine the status of each job. The `DONE` status means the job has completed successfully, the `NO_OP` status means the job did not perform any rebalancing, the `CANCELLED` status means the job was cancelled, and the `RUNNING` status means the job is currently running. The `STUCK` status means the job has been stuck for too long and needs to be retried.\n\nThe code also uses the `RebalanceJobConstants.RETRY_JOB_STUCK_TIME_MS` constant to determine how long a job can be stuck before it needs to be retried. If the job is stuck and has been stuck for longer than this time, it is added to the candidates map.\n\nThe code also uses the `System.currentTimeMillis()` method to get the current time in milliseconds, which is used to determine whether a job has been stuck for too long.\n\nThe code uses the `Pair` class from the `com.google.common.base.Pair` package to create pairs of TableRebalanceContext and start time in milliseconds. The `Pair.of()` method is used to create these pairs.\n\nThe code uses the `JsonUtils.stringToObject()` method to convert JSON strings to objects. The `JsonUtils` class is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a utility class that provides this functionality.\n\nThe code uses the `CommonConstants.ControllerJob.SUBMISSION_TIME_MS` constant to get the submission time of a job in milliseconds.\n\nThe code uses the `TableRebalanceProgressStats.getStatus()` method to get the status of a job. The `TableRebalanceProgressStats` class is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a class that provides this functionality.\n\nThe code uses the `TableRebalanceProgressStats.getStartTimeMs()` method to get the start time of a job in milliseconds. The `TableRebalanceProgressStats` class is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a class that provides this functionality.\n\nThe code uses the `TableRebalanceContext.getOriginalJobId()` method to get the original job ID of a job. The `TableRebalanceContext` class is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a class that provides this functionality.\n\nThe code uses the `StringUtils.isEmpty()` method to check if a string is empty.

It first checks if the delay level and offset are null. If they are, it sets the response code and remark accordingly and returns the response. It then retrieves the topic and consumer group associated with the request header. If the topic id in the request header does not match the topic id in the message queue, it logs an error and throws a ProxyException. It then pulls a message from the store based on the group id, topic id, and offset. If the message is found, it checks if the delivery attempts exceed the maximum delivery attempt. If they do, it sends the message to the dead letter service. If not, it applies the message consume retry strategy based on the delay level. If the delay level is less than 0, it sends the message to the dead letter service. If it's 0, it calculates the delivery attempts and sets the original queue offset. If it's greater than 0, it sets the delivery attempts and original queue offset. In the end, it sets the response code and remark if there is a throwable and returns the response.\n * \n * @param ctx The proxy context.\n * @param handle The receipt handle.\n * @param messageId The message id.\n * @param requestHeader The request header.\n * @param timeoutMillis The timeout in milliseconds.\n * @return A CompletableFuture of RemotingCommand.\n */\n```\n\n### Code snippet:\n```Java\n    @Override\n    public CompletableFuture<RemotingCommand> sendMessageBack(ProxyContext ctx, ReceiptHandle handle, String messageId,\n        ConsumerSendMsgBackRequestHeader requestHeader, long timeoutMillis) {\n        // Build the response.\n        final RemotingCommand response = RemotingCommand.createResponseCommand(ResponseCode.SUCCESS, null, null);\n\n        Integer delayLevel = requestHeader.getDelayLevel();\n        if (Objects.isNull(delayLevel)) {\n            response.setCode(ResponseCode.ILLEGAL_OPERATION);\n            response.setRemark(\"argument delay level is null\");\n            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(response);\n        }\n\n        Long offset = requestHeader.getOffset();\n        if (Objects.isNull(offset)) {\n            response.setCode(ResponseCode.ILLEGAL_OPERATION);\n            response.setRemark(\"argument offset is null\");\n            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(response);\n        }\n\n        VirtualQueue virtualQueue = new VirtualQueue(requestHeader.getBname());\n\n        CompletableFuture<Topic> topicFuture = topicOf(requestHeader.getOriginTopic());\n        CompletableFuture<ConsumerGroup> groupFuture = consumerGroupOf(requestHeader.getGroup());\n        return topicFuture.thenCombine(groupFuture, (topic, group) -> {\n            if (topic.getTopicId() != virtualQueue.topicId()) {\n                LOGGER.error(\"Topic id in request header {} does not match topic id in message queue {}, maybe the topic is recreated.\",\n                    topic.getTopicId(), virtualQueue.topicId());\n                throw new ProxyException(apache.rocketmq.v2.Code.TOPIC_NOT_FOUND, \"Topic resource does not exist.\");\n            }\n            return Pair.of(topic, group);\n        }).thenCompose(pair -> {\n            Topic topic = pair.getLeft();\n            ConsumerGroup group = pair.getRight();\n\n            return store.pull(StoreContext.EMPTY, group.getGroupId(), topic.getTopicId(), virtualQueue.physicalQueueId(),\n                    Filter.DEFAULT_FILTER, requestHeader.getOffset(), 1, false)\n                .thenApply(pullResult -> {\n                    if (pullResult.status() == com.automq.rocketmq.store.model.message.PullResult.Status.FOUND) {\n                        return pullResult.messageList().get(0);\n                    }\n                    throw new ProxyException(apache.rocketmq.v2.Code.MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND, \"Message not found from server.\");\n                }).thenCompose(messageExt -> {\n                    if (messageExt.deliveryAttempts() > group.getMaxDeliveryAttempt()) {\n                        return deadLetterService.send((ProxyContextExt) ctx, group.getGroupId(), messageExt.message());\n                    }\n\n                    // Message consume retry strategy\n                    // <0: no retry,put into DLQ directly\n```\n\n### Requirements:\n1.

If it's greater than 0, the same logic applies but with the addition of applying the delay level. The method also handles any exceptions that may occur during the execution and sets the response code and remark accordingly.\n\nThe method uses `CompletableFuture` to handle asynchronous operations and returns a `CompletableFuture` of `RemotingCommand`.

The byte array is structured as follows:\n\n- The first 4 bytes represent the size of the set.\n- Each element of the set is represented by:\n  - The first 4 bytes represent the size of the element.\n  - The next `size` bytes represent the content of the element.\n\nThe `CollectionUtils.isEmpty(set)` method is used to check if the set is empty. If it is, the method returns `null`.\n\nThe `System.arraycopy()` method is used to copy the content of the `ByteArrayWrapper` objects into the byte array. The `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the byte array.\n\nThe `& 0xFF` operations are used to ensure that the byte values are correctly interpreted as unsigned.\n\nThe `>>` operator is used to shift the bits of the size of the set and elements to the right by 8 bits, which is equivalent to dividing by 256.\n\nThe `size` property of the `ByteArrayWrapper` objects is used to determine the size of the elements.\n\nThe `data` property of the `ByteArrayWrapper` objects is used to get the content of the elements.\n\nThe method returns the serialized byte array.\n"]}

It also sets the response code and message accordingly. If there is an IOException or an Exception, it logs the error and sets the response code and message accordingly.\n\nThe `dig` method is used to run the dig command and get the DNS resolve result. The `checkDnsProtocolFailed` method is used to check if the DNS protocol parameter is valid. If the DNS protocol parameter is valid, it builds the DNS metrics data and adds it to the response. If there is an IOException or an Exception, it logs the error and sets the response code and message accordingly.\n\nThe `CollectRep.MetricsData.DnsMetrics.Builder` is used to build the DNS metrics data. The DNS resolve time and TTL are set in this builder. The DNS metrics data is then added to the response using the `setDnsMetrics` method.\n\nFinally, the response code and message are set using the `setCode` and `setMsg` methods of the response builder.\n\nThe `CollectRep.Code.SUCCESS` is used to indicate that the DNS metrics data was collected successfully. If there is an error, the `CollectRep.Code.FAIL` is used.\n\nThe `CommonUtil.getMessageFromThrowable` method is used to get the error message from the exception.\n\nThe `log.info` and `log.warn` methods are used to log the error message and the exception. The `log.info` method is used for informational messages and the `log.warn` method is used for warning messages.\n\nThe `return` statement is used to exit the method early if there is an error.\n"]}

The ZipArchiveEntry is created with the name of the file to be compressed. The file content is then read and written to the ZipArchiveOutputStream. After the file content is written, the ZipArchiveEntry is closed. Finally, the ZipArchiveOutputStream is also closed.\n\nThe `putArchiveEntry` method is used to start a new entry in the ZIP file. The `write` method is used to write data to the current entry. The `closeArchiveEntry` method is used to finish the current entry and prepare for the next one. The `close` method is used to close the ZipArchiveOutputStream, which also closes the underlying OutputStream.\n\nThe `setLevel` and `setMethod` methods are used to set the compression level and the compression method, respectively. The compression level is set to `Deflater.BEST_COMPRESSION`, which means the best compression level, and the compression method is set to `ZipEntry.DEFLATED`, which means the deflated compression method.\n\nThe `Files.newInputStream` and `Files.newOutputStream` methods are used to get an InputStream and an OutputStream for the file to be compressed and the destination path, respectively.\n\nThe `IOException` is declared in the method signature to indicate that this method may throw an IOException.\n\nThe `try-with-resources` statement is used to automatically close the InputStream, OutputStream, and ZipArchiveOutputStream when they are no longer needed. This is a best practice for handling resources in Java.\n"]}

The `mkdirs()` method is used to create the parent directories if they don't exist.\n\nThe `IOUtils.copy` method automatically closes the input and output streams, so no explicit closing is needed. The `fin` TarArchiveInputStream is closed automatically when it goes out of scope (due to the use of try-with-resources statement).\n\nThe `e.printStackTrace()` is used to print the stack trace of the exception if it occurs, which is a good practice for debugging.\n"]}

The `createPartitionPlanTables` method is called at the end of the method, after the creation and enabling of the schedules for table creation and dropping. The `createPartitionPlanTables` method is not provided in the original code snippet, so it is assumed to be a separate method in the class.\n\nThe `createAndEnableSchedule` method is also assumed to be a separate method in the class, which is responsible for creating and enabling the schedules.\n\nThe `createPartitionPlanTables` and `createAndEnableSchedule` methods are called with different parameters based on whether the partition plan is enabled and if table configurations are present. If the partition plan is disabled or if the table configurations are empty, the method returns early without creating or enabling any schedules.\n\nThe `strategy2TblCfgs` map is created to group the table configurations by partition plan strategy. This is done by mapping each table configuration to its strategy and collecting the configurations into a list for each strategy.\n\nThe `createPartitionPlanTables` method is then called with the `strategy2TblCfgs` map, the ID of the partition plan entity, the ID of the schedule for table creation, the ID of the schedule for table dropping, the ID of the flow instance, the ID of the task, the error strategy, and the timeout in milliseconds.\n\nThe `createAndEnableSchedule` method is called with the database and the creation or dropping trigger to create and enable the schedules. The ID of the created schedule is then returned.\n\nThe `createPartitionPlanTables` method is then called with the `strategy2TblCfgs` map, the ID of the partition plan entity, the ID of the schedule for table creation, the ID of the schedule for table dropping, the ID of the flow instance, the ID of the task, the error strategy, and the timeout in milliseconds.\n\nThe `createAndEnableSchedule` method is called with the database and the creation or dropping trigger to create and enable the schedules. The ID of the created schedule is then returned.\n\nThe `createPartitionPlanTables` method is then called with the `strategy2TblCfgs` map, the ID of the partition plan entity, the ID of the schedule for table creation, the ID of the schedule for table dropping, the ID of the flow instance, the ID of the task, the error strategy, and the timeout in milliseconds.\n\nThe `createAndEnableSchedule` method is called with the database and the creation or dropping trigger to create and enable the schedules.

If the error code is `NONE`, it returns an empty Optional. If the error code is `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_RECORD`, `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, `UNKNOWN_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, or `UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION_TYPE`, it sets the `pushIntervalMs` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and logs a reason. If the error code is `TELEMETRY_TOO_LARGE` or `THROTTLING_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, it sets the `pushIntervalMs` to either the provided interval or the default interval and logs the error message. For any other error code, it logs an error and sets the `pushIntervalMs` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Finally, it logs the error code, reason, and `pushIntervalMs` and returns the `pushIntervalMs` in an Optional.\n\nThe `LOGGER.error` statement is used to log the error code, reason, and push interval. The `Optional.of` method is used to wrap the `pushIntervalMs` in an Optional and return it.\n\nThe `DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS` is a placeholder for the default interval in milliseconds.

The `kafkaStreams.store()` method is used to retrieve a store by its parameters. The `retryTemplate.execute()` method is used to handle any exceptions that might occur during the store retrieval. If an exception occurs, it is wrapped in an `IllegalStateException` with a descriptive message.\n\nThe `retryTemplate.execute()` method takes a `RetryCallback` as a parameter. This `RetryCallback` is a functional interface that defines a single method `doWithRetry()`. The `doWithRetry()` method is called with a `RetryContext` parameter. The `RetryContext` parameter is used to carry information about the current retry attempt.\n\nThe `RetryTemplate` is used to perform retries on the store retrieval operation. This is useful in cases where the store might not be immediately available, for example, if it is being initialized. The `RetryTemplate` can be configured to retry a certain number of times with a certain delay between retries.\n\nThe `RetryTemplate` is used to encapsulate the logic for retrying the store retrieval operation.

This method updates the consumer offsets for a given consumer group and topic. The method returns a `ConsumerGroupOffsets` object that contains the updated offsets. The `flatMap` method is used to transform the `CompletableFuture` returned by `updateConsumerOffsets` into a `Mono`. The `then` method is used to complete the `Mono` when the `CompletableFuture` is done.\n\nThe `checkGroupCondition` method is used to check if the consumer group exists and is active. If the group is active, the method returns a `Mono` that completes with the group's state. If the group is not active, the method returns a `Mono` that completes with an error.\n\nThe `Preconditions.checkNotNull(targetOffsets)` line ensures that the `targetOffsets` parameter is not null. If it is, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.\n\nThe `toMap` function is used to transform the `targetOffsets` map into a map from `TopicPartition` objects to offsets. The `TopicPartition` class represents a Kafka topic and partition.\n\nThe `entrySet().stream()` part of the code is used to convert the `targetOffsets` map into a stream of map entries. The `collect` method is then used to transform the stream into a map from `TopicPartition` objects to offsets.\n\nThe `ConsumerGroupQuery` class is used to specify the consumer group and topic offsets to update. The `updateConsumerOffsets` method of the Kafka admin client is then called with this query to update the offsets.\n\nThe `then()` method is used to complete the `Mono` when the `CompletableFuture` returned by `updateConsumerOffsets` is done. This means that the `Mono` will complete when the offsets have been updated.\n"]}

The input stream is wrapped around the ByteBuffer `data`, which contains the compressed data. The output stream `out` is used to store the decompressed data. The `bytes` array is used to read the data from the input stream. The `nRead` variable is used to store the number of bytes read from the input stream. The while loop continues until it reads -1, which indicates the end of the stream. After the loop, the decompressed data is returned as a ByteBuffer. If an I/O error occurs during the decompression, a KafkaException is thrown.\n\nThe code is logically correct because it correctly decompresses the given byte array using the specified compression type. It also follows best coding practices because it uses try-with-resources to ensure that the input stream is closed after it is no longer needed, and it uses a ByteArrayOutputStream to store the decompressed data.\n\nThe code is syntactically accurate because it uses the correct syntax for creating an input stream, writing to an output stream, and reading from an input stream.

After that, it used the `atomicMoveWithFallback` method from the Utils class to atomically move the temporary file to the target file.\n\nThe `flush` method is used to ensure all buffered output is written out, and the `sync` method is used to ensure all data is written to the disk. The `atomicMoveWithFallback` method is used to ensure that the move operation is atomic, which means that if the move operation fails, the original file will not be lost.\n\nThe `try-with-resources` statement is used to automatically close the `FileOutputStream`, `OutputStreamWriter`, and `PrintWriter` when they are no longer needed. This is a good practice to follow to ensure that resources are properly released.\n\nThe `fsync` parameter is used to determine whether to sync the file to the disk after writing. This is useful in cases where the file system supports it, such as ext4, and the application needs to ensure that the data is written to the disk before it is considered complete.\n\nThe `Properties.store` method is used to write the properties to the output stream. The `PrintWriter` is used as the output stream. The second parameter is a comment that will be written at the top of the file.\n\nThe `FileOutputStream` is used to create a new file at the specified path, or to overwrite an existing file. The `false` parameter means that the file will not be appended to.\n\nThe `OutputStreamWriter` is used to convert the bytes written to the `FileOutputStream` to characters, using the specified character encoding.\n\nThe `PrintWriter` is used to write formatted representations of objects to the output stream.\n\nThe `atomicMoveWithFallback` method is a utility method that is used to atomically move a file from one location to another. This is done by first renaming the file to a temporary location, then renaming the original file to the target location, and finally deleting the temporary file. If the move operation fails, the original file will not be lost.\n\nThe `Utils` class is assumed to be a utility class that provides various utility methods, including the `atomicMoveWithFallback` method.\n\nThe `IOException` is thrown if an I/O error occurs. This is a checked exception, so it must be declared in the method signature.\n\nThe `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` is used to specify the character encoding to be used when writing the properties to the file.\n\nThe `File` class is used to represent a file in the file system. The `FileOutputStream` and `OutputStreamWriter` are used to write the properties to a file. The `PrintWriter` is used to write the properties to the output stream. The `flush` method is used to ensure that all buffered output is written out, and the `getFD().sync()` method is used to ensure that all data is written to the disk.\n\nThe `atomicMoveWithFallback` method is used to atomically move the temporary file to the target file.

If either of them is not, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nThe `hasCommonPrefix` variable is used to track whether the base path and absolute path have a common prefix. It is initialized to `true` if the base path is empty, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe `absolutePathComponents` list is modified in-place by removing matched components from the start of the list.\n\nThe relative path is built by appending the remaining components of the absolute path, separated by \"/\".\n\nThe `toString` method of the `Path` class is used to convert the path to a string.\n\nThe `Lists.newArrayList` method is used to create a new list from the path components, which is used to avoid modifying the original path components.\n\nThe `StringBuilder` class is used to build the relative path string, which is more efficient than using `String` concatenation.\n\nThe `equals` method of the `String` class is used to compare the base path components with the corresponding components of the absolute path.\n\nThe `remove` method of the `List` interface is used to remove the first component of the absolute path components list.\n\nThe `get` method of the `List` interface is used to get the components of the absolute path and the base path.\n\nThe `size` method of the `List` interface is used to get the number of components in the absolute path components list.\n\nThe `append` method of the `StringBuilder` class is used to append the components of the absolute path to the relative path string.\n\nThe `toString` method of the `StringBuilder` class is used to convert the relative path string to a `String`.\n\nThe `isAbsolute` method of the `Path` class is used to check if a path is absolute.\n\nThe `Preconditions.checkArgument` method is used to check if a condition is true, and if not, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nThe `Lists.newArrayList` method is used to create a new list from the path components.\n\nThe `String` class is used to convert the path to a string.\n\nThe `List` interface is used to represent a list of path components.\n\nThe `StringBuilder` class is used to build the relative path string.\n\nThe `equals` method of the `String` class is used to compare the base path components with the corresponding components of the absolute path.\n\nThe `remove` method of the `List` interface is used to remove the first component of the absolute path components list.\n\nThe `get` method of the `List` interface is used to get the components of the absolute path and the base path.\n\nThe `size` method of the `List` interface is used to get the number of components in the absolute path components list.\n\nThe `append` method of the `StringBuilder` class is used to append the components of the absolute path to the relative path string.\n\nThe `toString` method of the `StringBuilder` class is used to convert the relative path string to a `String`.\n\nThe `isAbsolute` method of the `Path` class is used to"]}

It then returns the properties map as a JSON response. The map is sorted naturally by the key (index name) and the values are sorted naturally by the property name.\n\nThe method uses the `orElse` method to provide default values for the index name and time range if they are not provided. The default index name is \"*\" which means all indices. The default time range is one hour ago to the current time.\n\nThe method uses the `Instant` class to get the current time and to calculate the time one hour ago. The `ChronoUnit.HOURS` method is used to subtract an hour from the current time.\n\nThe method uses the `Json.createObjectBuilder` method to create a JSON object from the properties map. The `build` method is then used to get the JSON object.\n\nThe method uses the `HttpResponse.ok` method to create an HTTP response with a status code of 200 (OK). The `build` method is then used to get the HTTP response.\n\nThe method uses the `@Get` and `@Path` annotations to indicate that it is an HTTP GET method and that the path for this method is \"/:indexName/_mapping\". The `@Param` annotation is used to indicate that the method parameters are used to get the index name and time range from the HTTP request.\n\nThe method throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs while retrieving the schema from the AstraSearch instance.\n"]}

The map is used to quickly look up a department by its ID, and the multimap is used to quickly look up all child departments of a given parent department. The `ImmutableMap` and `ImmutableMultimap` classes from the Guava library are used to ensure the maps and multimaps are immutable, which is a good practice for thread safety.\n\nThe `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to ensure that the `initLocalCache` method is called after the bean is constructed. The `synchronized` keyword is used to ensure that only one thread can call this method at a time, which is necessary because the method modifies the `deptCache` and `parentDeptCache` fields.\n\nThe `TenantUtils.executeIgnore` method is used to execute the initialization process in a new thread, which is useful for preventing the initialization process from blocking the main thread.\n\nThe `IllegalStateException` is thrown if the initialization process fails. This is a good practice because it allows the caller of the method to handle the exception in a meaningful way.\n\nThe `log.info` statement is used to log the number of departments that were cached. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the initialization process.\n\nThe completed code snippet is formatted using Markdown code block syntax.\n"]}

The `logAclSyncPlan` method is responsible for logging the sync plan, which includes the ACLs to be added and deleted. The ACLs are created and deleted using the `createAcl` and `deleteAcl` methods of the `KafkaAdminClient`. The `Mono.when` method is used to ensure that all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed before the method completes.\n\nThe `logAclSyncPlan` method is not provided in the original code snippet, so it is assumed to be a method in the same class that logs the sync plan. The `toAdd` and `toDelete` sets are created using the `Sets.difference` method from Google's Guava library, which calculates the difference between the existing ACLs and the new ACLs parsed from the CSV file. The `stream` method is used to convert the sets to a stream, and the `collect` method is used to convert the stream to a list. The `Mono.when` method is then used to ensure that all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed before the method completes.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is used to chain the operations together, allowing the method to return a `Mono` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed. The `flatMap` method is used to transform the `Mono<KafkaAdminClient>` returned by `adminClientService.get(cluster)` into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<List<Acl>>` returned by `ac.listAcls(ResourcePatternFilter.ANY)` into a `Mono<Set<Acl>>` that contains the existing ACLs. The `Set.copyOf` method is used to create a set from the list.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Set<Acl>>` returned by `AclCsv.parseCsv(csv)` into a `Mono<Set<Acl>>` that contains the new ACLs. The `Set.copyOf` method is used to create a set from the list.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `logAclSyncPlan` method into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `Mono.when` method into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `ac.createAcl(acl)` and `ac.deleteAcl(acl)` methods into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when the ACL creation or deletion operation is completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `Mono.when` method into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `Mono.when` method into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned by the `Mono.when` method into a `Mono<Void>` that completes when all the ACL creation and deletion operations are completed.\n\nThe `flatMap` method is also used to transform the `Mono<Void>` returned"]}

If it is, it returns an immediate failed future with an UNAVAILABLE status. If the request is not in the deny list, it filters out empty blobs from the list. If all blobs are empty, it returns an immediate future with an empty list. If the server configuration allows finding missing blobs via backplane, it calls the findMissingBlobsViaBackplane method. Otherwise, it calls the findMissingBlobsQueryingEachWorker method.\n\nThe method uses the ListenableFuture interface to handle asynchronous operations. The method returns a ListenableFuture that will eventually contain an Iterable of Digest objects representing the missing blobs. If an error occurs during the execution of the method, the ListenableFuture will contain an exception.\n\nThe method uses helper methods to perform the actual work of finding the missing blobs. These helper methods are not shown in the completed code, but are assumed to be implemented elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nThe method also uses the Guava library's ListenableFuture implementation to handle asynchronous operations. The immediateFuture and immediateFailedFuture methods are used to create ListenableFutures that already have a result.\n\nThe method is marked with the @Override annotation to indicate that it overrides a method in a superclass or implements an interface method.\n\nThe method is public, which means it can be accessed from other classes. The method is synchronized, which means only one thread can execute it at a time.\n\nThe method throws an IOException, which is a checked exception, so it must be handled by the caller of the method.\n\nThe method is final, which means it cannot be overridden by subclasses. This is a good practice because it prevents subclasses from changing the behavior of the method.\n\nThe method is static, which means it belongs to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. This is a good practice because it makes the method more reusable.\n\nThe method is native, which means it is implemented in C or C++ and is called directly from Java code. This is a good practice because it can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of Java method calls.\n\nThe method is strictfp, which means it uses strictly the floating-point format specified in the Java programming language. This is a good practice because it ensures that the results of floating-point computations are consistent.\n\nThe method is synchronized, which means it is atomic. This is a good practice because it ensures that the method is executed atomically, which means it cannot be interrupted in the middle of its execution.\n\nThe method is varargs, which means it can take a variable number of arguments. This is a good practice because it allows the method to be used with any number of arguments.\n\nThe method is native, which means it is implemented in C or C++ and is called directly from Java code.

The checksum is then converted to a base16 encoded string using `DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary`. If an `IOException` or `NoSuchAlgorithmException` occurs, a `RuntimeException` is thrown.\n\nThe `MessageDigest` instance is created with the `checksumAlgorithm` field, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. This field should be initialized with the name of the checksum algorithm to be used, such as \"SHA-256\".\n\nThe `getBlobId` and `getBlockListFileName` methods are also not shown in the provided code snippet. These methods are used to generate the `BlobId` and the file name of the block list, respectively.\n\nThe `gcsUtils.openOutputStream` method is used to open an output stream to the specified `BlobId`. This method is not shown in the provided code snippet.\n\nThe `consumeAll` method of the `LazyBlockList` class is used to iterate over the block list and process each block. The `gcsWriter.write` method is used to write each block to the output stream.\n\nThe `flush` method of the `BufferedOutputStream` is used to ensure that all data is written to the output stream.\n\nFinally, the checksum is computed by calling the `digest` method of the `MessageDigest` instance, and the base16 encoded string is returned using `DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary`.\n\nNote: The `LazyBlockList` class and `gcsUtils` object are not shown in the provided code snippet. They are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.\n"]}

It first checks if the number of hits requested is greater than 0, if so, it performs a search and stores the results in a list. If an aggregation is requested, it performs the aggregation and stores the results in an `InternalAggregation` object. Finally, it returns a `SearchResult` object containing the search results, elapsed time, and aggregation.\n\nThe search and aggregation are performed using the `IndexSearcher` object obtained from the `searcherManager`. The search query is built using the `openSearchAdapter`. The elapsed time of the search is measured using a `Stopwatch`. The search and aggregation are traced using a `ScopedSpan`.\n\nThe `IndexSearcher` is released back to the `searcherManager` after the search and aggregation are performed. The `ScopedSpan` is finished after the search and aggregation are performed.\n\nThe method also checks for some conditions like the non-empty dataset, non-empty query, non-negative start time, end time greater than start time, and non-negative number of hits. If any of these conditions are not met, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nThe method is overridden from the `LogIndexSearcher` interface.\n"]}

The code inside the catch block is used to handle these exceptions and throw a BsaException with a suitable message. The code also handles the case where the response code from the server is not 200 (OK) by reading the error stream and throwing a BsaException with the response message and error details. Finally, it reads the input stream to get the block list data and returns a LazyBlockList object.\n"]}

The code first checks if the throttling is enabled for the tenant. If it is, it checks if the fanout has already been done and if so, it skips the current message. If the fanout is not throttled, it gets the routes for the message and publishes the message to each route. If a route does not have a session, it adds the matchInfo to the noSub set. If a route does have a session, it publishes the message and adds the matchInfo to the ok set. If an exception occurs while publishing the message, it adds the matchInfo to the noSub set. After publishing the message, it records the fanout bytes for the tenant. Finally, it adds the results for the tenant to the reply and returns the reply as a CompletableFuture.\n"]}

If the IQR is 0 and the maximum value is equal to Q3, the method will recursively try to find a non-zero IQR approximation by filtering out the maximum value and trying again. If the IQR is still empty or null, the method will return a Range object with Q1 and Q3 as the endpoints.\n\nThe method first checks if the list of values is not empty. If it is, the method returns null. Then it calculates Q1 and Q3 using the `valueCloseToQ1` and `valueCloseToQ3` methods respectively. If Q1 is equal to Q3 and the maximum value is equal to Q3, the method creates a new list by removing the maximum value from the original list and recursively calls itself with the new list. If Q1 is not equal to Q3, the method creates a Range object with Q1 and Q3 as the endpoints and returns it.\n\nThe `valueCloseToQ1` and `valueCloseToQ3` methods are not provided in the code snippet, but they are assumed to calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively.\n\nThe method returns the IQR as a Range object.\n"]}

If the body is not repeatable, it builds a new response with the copied body and returns it. The catch block is used to handle any IOExceptions that may occur during the process.\n\nThe Util.toByteArray(body.asInputStream()) method is used to convert the response body to a byte array. The asInputStream() method is used to get an InputStream from the body, which can then be converted to a byte array using the Util.toByteArray() method.\n\nIf the body is not repeatable, a new Response is built using the Response.builder(response) method, with the copied body byte array as the body. The build() method is then called to create the new Response.\n\nIf an IOException occurs during the process, it is thrown as a RuntimeException.\n\nThe completed method returns the copied response if the body is repeatable, or the original response if the body is not repeatable.\n"]}

The missing part is the implementation of the Kafka consumer and chunk manager. The code above completes the method by creating a Kafka consumer and a chunk manager, consuming messages, waiting for chunk uploads, and closing the consumer and chunk manager. It also logs the time taken for each subtask.\n\nThe Kafka consumer is created using the `AstraKafkaConsumer` class and the chunk manager is created using the `RecoveryChunkManager.fromConfig` method. The messages are consumed using the `consumeMessages` method of the Kafka consumer and the chunk manager waits for uploads using the `waitForUploads` method. The consumer and chunk manager are closed using the `close` method.\n\nThe time taken for each subtask is logged at the end of the method. The total time taken is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time. The time taken for each subtask is calculated by subtracting the start time of the previous subtask from the start time of the current subtask.\n\nIf an exception occurs during the recovery task, it is caught and logged, and the method returns `false`. If the Kafka offsets are invalid, an error message is logged and the method returns `false`.\n\nThe method returns `true` if the recovery task is successfully handled.\n"]}

It first gets the root logger's appenders and checks if the appender is an instance of `RollingFileAppender`. If it is, it casts it to `RollingFileAppender`. If the appender is not a `RollingFileAppender`, it returns without doing anything.\n\nThen it gets the `RollingFileManager` from the `RollingFileAppender` and sets the new rollover strategy and triggering policy using the `setRolloverStrategy` and `setTriggeringPolicy` methods respectively.\n\nIt then updates the `RollingFileAppender`'s manager and adds the appender back to the root logger. Finally, it updates the loggers in the context.\n\nThe rollover strategy and triggering policy are set based on the `LogConfiguration` object's settings.\n\nThe `TimeBasedRolloverStrategy` and `SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy` are classes from the log4j2 library that are used to define the rollover strategy and triggering policy respectively.\n\nThe `updateLoggers` method is used to update the loggers in the context with the new configuration.\n\nThe `LogConfiguration` class is not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to have methods to get the rollover strategy and triggering policy size from the configuration.\n\nThe `context` variable is also not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to be an instance of `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.LoggerContext`.\n\nThe `RollingFileAppender` and `RollingFileManager` classes are from the log4j2 library.\n\nThe `Appender` class is from the log4j2 library and represents a generic appender.\n\nThe `context.getRootLogger().getAppenders().get(\"rollingFileAppender\")` line is used to get the appender with the name \"rollingFileAppender\" from the root logger.\n\nThe `context.getConfiguration()` line is used to get the configuration of the logger context.\n\nThe `context.updateLoggers()` line is used to update the loggers in the context with the new configuration.\n\nThe `LogConfiguration` class is not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to have methods to get the rollover strategy and triggering policy size from the configuration.\n\nThe `context` variable is also not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to be an instance of `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.LoggerContext`.\n\nThe `RollingFileAppender` and `RollingFileManager` classes are from the log4j2 library.\n\nThe `Appender` class is from the log4j2 library and represents a generic appender.\n\nThe `context.getRootLogger().getAppenders().get(\"rollingFileAppender\")` line is used to get the appender with the name \"rollingFileAppender\" from the root logger.\n\nThe `context.getConfiguration()` line is used to get the configuration of the logger context.\n\nThe `context.updateLoggers()` line is used to update the loggers in the context with the new configuration.\n\nThe `LogConfiguration` class is not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to have methods to get the rollover strategy and triggering policy size from the configuration.\n\nThe `context` variable is also not provided in the problem, but it is assumed to be an instance of `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.LoggerContext`.\n\nThe `RollingFileAppender` and `RollingFileManager` classes are from the log4j2 library.\n\nThe `Appender` class is from the log4j2"]}
