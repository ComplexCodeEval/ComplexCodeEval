It also allows for resizing of the image if the `max_height` and `max_width` parameters are provided.\n\nThe function first checks if the reference is a URL, in which case it calls the `load_image_from_url` function. If the reference is a local file path, it reads the image using `cv2.imread` and checks if the `max_height` and `max_width` parameters are `None`. If they are, it reads the image as it is and encodes it to base64. If they are not `None`, it resizes the image using the `resize_image` function and then encodes the resized image to base64.\n\nIf the reference is a base64 encoded string, it calls the `load_image_from_base64` function. If the reference is none of the above, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\n\nThe `encode_base_64`, `uri_is_http_link`, `is_base64_encoded`, `load_image_from_base64`, `load_image_from_url`, `resize_image`, and `calculate_scaling_factor` functions are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.\n"]}

It first gets the enemy mask from the given `MiniMapInfo` object. Then it dilates the enemy mask to find connected components. For each connected component, it checks if the area is greater than 50. If it is, it adds the centroid of the component to the `pos_list` as a `Point` object. Finally, it returns the `pos_list`.\n\nThe `Point` class is a simple class that represents a point in 2D space. It has two attributes, `x` and `y`, which represent the x and y coordinates of the point.\n\nThe `cv2_utils.show_image` function is used to display the enemy mask. It is commented out in the provided code snippet, so it is not used in the completed function.\n\nThe `cv2.connectedComponentsWithStats` function is used to find connected components in the dilated enemy mask. It returns the number of labels, the label image, the statistics of each label, and the centroids of each label. The statistics include the location and size of the bounding box, area, and the centroid of the connected component.\n\nThe `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop if the area of the connected component is less than 50. This is done to filter out small connected components that are likely not enemies.\n\nThe `pos_list.append(Point(int(centroids[i][0]), int(centroids[i][1])))` line is used to add a new `Point` object to the `pos_list` for each connected component. The `int` function is used to convert the centroid coordinates from float to int.\n\nThe `return pos_list` statement is used to return the `pos_list` after all the connected components have been processed.\n"]}

The function takes in parameters such as `real_client_ids`, `canary_client_ids`, `total_rounds`, `num_real_epochs`, `canary_repeats`, and `seed`.\n\nThe function first checks if `real_client_ids` is empty and if `total_rounds` is less than or equal to 0. If either of these conditions is true, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nThe function then creates a random number generator (`rng`) using the provided `seed`. It creates permutations of the `real_client_ids` and `canary_client_ids` for the `real_order` and `canary_order` respectively.\n\nThe function then defines a nested function `sampling_fn`. This function takes in a `round_num` and returns a list of client IDs for that round. If `round_num` is less than or equal to `num_real_epochs`, it returns the `real_client_ids` in the order specified by `real_order`. Otherwise, it calculates the `canary_round` and returns the `canary_client_ids` in the order specified by `canary_order[canary_round]`.\n\nFinally, the function calculates the `mean_clients_per_round` by adding `num_real_epochs` and the product of `num_canary` and `canary_repeats` divided by `total_rounds`. It returns a tuple containing the `sampling_fn` and `mean_clients_per_round`.\n```\n\n### Note:\nThe provided code snippet is incomplete.

It first computes the mel spectrogram bins up to the nyquist frequency. Then it computes the center frequencies of the mel bands, and the lower and upper bounds of the mel bands. Finally, it computes the weight matrix by iterating over the mel bands and setting the weights accordingly. The weight matrix is returned as a 2D array.\n\nThe function uses the `hertz_to_warped_scale` function to convert the linear frequencies to the mel scale. The `np.linspace` function is used to generate the center frequencies of the mel bands, and the `np.where` function is used to set the weights of the spectrogram bins that fall within each mel band.\n\nThe function assumes that the `hertz_to_warped_scale` function is defined elsewhere in the code. If it is not, you will need to define it or import it from a module.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `FrequencyScale` enum is defined elsewhere in the code. If it is not, you will need to define it or import it from a module.\n\nThe function uses the `np.float64` data type by default, but this can be overridden by passing a different data type as an argument.\n\nThe function does not handle any exceptions or errors. If an error occurs, it will be raised and the program will terminate.\n\nThe function does not include any comments or documentation strings. If you want to add comments or documentation strings, you can do so, but they should be added in a way that is consistent with the rest of the code.\n"]}

The function takes as input the linear operator `A`, the starting vector `start_vector`, the maximum number of Arnoldi iterations `max_iters`, the tolerance for the convergence of the Arnoldi process `tol`, and a boolean `pbar` to display a progress bar.\n\nThe function first defines the `matvec` function, which computes the matrix-vector product of `A` with the input vector `x`. The `norm` function computes the Euclidean norm of the input vector `x`.\n\nThe function then defines the `arnoldi_iteration` function, which performs one iteration of the Arnoldi process. This involves computing the next orthonormal basis vectors `w` and the next orthogonal complement basis vectors `h`, and updating the matrix `H` and the matrix `V`.\n\nThe function then initializes the matrix `V` and the matrix `H` with the starting vector `v0` and the zero matrix respectively. It then enters a loop where it performs the Arnoldi process for a maximum number of iterations. The loop breaks when the norm of the last vector in the basis `V` is less than the tolerance `tol`.\n\nAfter the loop, the function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix `H` using the NumPy's `linalg.eig` function. It then sorts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in ascending order.\n\nFinally, the function returns the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and a dictionary with additional information about the computation.\n\nNote: The function uses the NumPy library for numerical computations. The `xnp` variable is used to access the NumPy functions and constants. The `LinearOperator` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.\n"]}

It first applies the boolean mask to the logits, labels, and video IDs. Then it finds the unique video IDs. For each unique video ID, it calculates the mean of the corresponding logits, labels, and frame masks (if provided). The function returns a tuple of the deduplicated logits, labels, and video IDs. If frame masks are provided, it also returns the deduplicated frame masks.\n\nThe deduplication is done by taking the mean of the logits and labels for each unique video ID. This is done using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python. The `np.unique` function is used to get the unique video IDs, and the `mean` method is used to calculate the mean of the corresponding elements.\n\nIf frame masks are provided, they are also deduplicated by taking the mean of the corresponding frame masks for each unique video ID. The deduplicated frame masks are returned along with the deduplicated logits, labels, and video IDs.\n\nThe function assumes that the logits, labels, and video IDs are numpy arrays of the same length. If the frame masks are provided, they should also be numpy arrays of the same length as the logits and labels.\n\nThe function also assumes that the logits, labels, and video IDs are numerical arrays. If the frame masks are provided, they should be boolean arrays.\n\nThe function does not handle any potential errors or exceptions. If the input arrays are not of the correct length or type, the function may not work as expected.\n"]}

It uses the confusion matrix from the `sklearn.metrics` module to calculate the true positive (tp), true negative (tn), false positive (fp), and false negative (fn) rates. The informedness statistic is then calculated as the average of the sensitivity (tp / (tp + fn)) and specificity (tn / (tn + fp)).\n\nThe balanced accuracy score is the average of recall obtained on each class which is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. The balanced accuracy is useful in multi-class classification where the classes are imbalanced.\n\nThe informedness statistic is a measure of the balance between sensitivity and specificity, which are measures of the proportion of true positives and true negatives among the total number of positives and negatives, respectively.\n\nThe confusion matrix is a 2x2 table that is used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of data for which the true values are known. The confusion matrix itself is relatively simple to understand, but the related terminology can be confusing.\n\nThe confusion matrix was introduced by Paul W. Rogers in 1972 and introduced to the field of statistics by John W. Tukey.

This is done by creating a pandas DataFrame with the feature and the model's predictions, and then calculating the correlation between the two. If the absolute value of the correlation is greater than the correlation threshold, a new Issue is created and added to the list of issues. The function then returns the list of issues.\n\nThe completed part of the function is the calculation of the correlation and the creation of the Issue. The correlation is calculated using the `.corr()` method of the DataFrame, which returns a correlation matrix. The correlation between the feature and the model's predictions is the value in the first row and first column of the correlation matrix. The Issue is created by passing the issue description, the correlation, the measure name, the measure function, and the slice function to the Issue constructor.\n\nThe function also includes logging information at the start and end of its execution.\n\nThe function also checks if the slice is small and if so, skips it. This is done by checking if the length of the slice is less than 20 or less than 5% of the length of the dataset. If either of these conditions is true, the slice is skipped.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of issues. If no issues were found, the list will be empty.\n"]}

It is first checking if the sampling strategy is either 'random' or 'linspace'. If it is 'random', it calculates the start frame offset. If it is 'linspace', it leaves the start frame offset as 0.0. Then, it checks if the displacement normalizer is either 'duration' or 'sampled_span'. If it is 'duration', it sets the displacement multiplier to the total number of frames. If it is 'sampled_span', it sets the displacement multiplier to the number of frames times the stride. If the normalizer is neither of these, it sets the displacement multiplier to 1.\n\nNext, it checks if there is a feature pyramid configuration. If there is, it splits the displacements into levels using the split_pyramid_features function from model_utils. If the normalize_displacements_by_downsample_stride option is True, it normalizes the displacements by the downsample stride.\n\nFinally, it calculates the class indices, class probabilities, and segments. The class indices are calculated using the argmax function on the class probabilities. The class probabilities are calculated using the max function on the class probabilities. The segments are calculated using the arange function and rounded to the nearest integer. The segments are then divided by the seconds per timestep and converted to integers.\n\nThe function then returns the class indices, class probabilities, and segments.\n"]}

It then calls the `plot_distribution` function to plot the distribution of these events.\n\nNext, it plots the subclass distribution and then the hierarchical layers. For the subclass distribution, it extracts the subclass from each clip in the dataset. It then calls the `plot_distribution` function to plot the distribution of these subclasses.\n\nFor the hierarchical layers, it iterates over each layer and extracts the subclass from each clip in the dataset. It then calls the `plot_distribution` function to plot the distribution of these subclasses.\n\nFinally, it uses `plt.tight_layout()` to adjust the subplot parameters so that the subplots are nicely fit in the figure, and `plt.show()` to display the plots.\n\nThe `plot_distribution` function is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a function that takes a list of values, a title, a y-axis label, a x-axis label, a list of axes, and a subplot position, and plots a distribution of these values on the specified axes at the specified subplot position.\n"]}

Then it uses the `render` method of the template object to render the template with the provided metadata variables. The formatted content and the output path of the template file are returned as a `TemplateOutput` object.\n\nThe `env.get_template(str(path.relative_to(base_path)))` line assumes that `env` is a Jinja2 environment that has been set up elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe `path.with_suffix(\".formatted\" + path.suffix)` line creates a new path for the output file by changing the suffix of the input path to \".formatted\" plus the original suffix.\n\nThe `ProjectMetadata.model_dump()` line assumes that `ProjectMetadata` is a Pydantic model that has been set up elsewhere in the code. It converts the `ProjectMetadata` object to a dictionary, which is used as the context for the Jinja2 template.\n\nThe `TemplateOutput` is a dataclass that is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. It has two fields: `content`, which is the formatted content of the template, and `path`, which is the path to which the formatted content should be written.\n"]}

It is a method of a class that generates a set of instructions based on random mutations. The method uses an instance variable `self.llm` to generate prompts, and then checks if the generated prompts meet certain length requirements. If they do, they are added to the `instructions` list. The method continues to generate prompts and add them to the list until the list contains a specified number of instructions. The method also logs information about the process.\n\nThe code snippet does not seem to have any missing parts, so no additional implementation is needed.\n"]}

It uses the Docker Hub API to fetch the tags. The function takes a filter function as an argument, which is used to filter the tags. The function also takes a `num_tags` argument, which is the maximum number of tags to return. If `num_tags` is None, all tags are returned. The function returns a list of fully qualified Docker image tags that pass the filter function and are sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe function uses a while loop to query the Docker Hub API until it has fetched all the tags. The function also handles errors returned by the Docker Hub API by raising a ValueError with the error message.\n\nThe function uses the requests library to make the HTTP requests to the Docker Hub API. The function uses the `headers` dictionary to include the Docker Hub token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.\n\nThe function uses the `url` variable to specify the URL of the Docker Hub API endpoint that returns the tags. The function uses the `page_count` variable to specify the page number of the tags to return in the HTTP request.\n\nThe function uses the `response` variable to store the HTTP response from the Docker Hub API. The function uses the `response_json` variable to store the JSON data from the HTTP response.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the tags in the JSON data. The function uses the `filter_func` function to filter the tags. The function uses the `filtered_tags` list to store the tags that pass the filter.\n\nThe function uses an if statement to check if the `num_tags` argument is specified and if the number of filtered tags is greater than or equal to `num_tags`. If the condition is true, the function breaks the while loop.\n\nThe function uses the `filtered_tags` list to store the fully qualified Docker image tags. The function uses the `sort` method of the `filtered_tags` list to sort the tags in ascending order.\n\nThe function returns the `filtered_tags` list.\n"]}

The mask is represented as a 2D tensor, where a value of 1 indicates a causal edge and a value of 0 indicates a non-causal edge. The indices of the edges in the graph are represented as a 2xN tensor, where N is the number of edges. The function compares the source and destination indices of each edge with the indices of all other edges. If the source index of an edge is greater than the index of any other edge, it is considered a causal edge. The function sets the corresponding value in the mask to 1.\n\nThe line `idx = torch.arange(edge_idx.size(1), device=edge_idx.device)` generates a tensor of indices from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of edges. The line `mask_ij[edge_idx[0] > idx, edge_idx[1] > idx] = 1` compares the source and destination indices of each edge with the indices of all other edges. If the source index of an edge is greater than the index of any other edge, it is considered a causal edge. The function sets the corresponding value in the mask to 1.\n\nThe function returns the mask tensor.\n"]}

It first applies the window function to the waveform. Then, if a preemphasis coefficient is provided, it applies preemphasis to the waveform. After that, it computes the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the waveform. The magnitude spectrogram is computed by taking the power of the STFT result. If Mel filters are provided, the magnitude spectrogram is transformed using these filters. If a logarithmic scaling is requested, it is applied to the magnitude spectrogram. If requested, the DC offset is removed from the magnitude spectrogram. Finally, the spectrogram is converted to the desired data type and returned.\n\nNote: The function uses the `librosa` library for STFT computation and other operations. If you are not using `librosa`, you may need to replace these calls with equivalent functions from another library.\n\nAlso, the function assumes that the input waveform is a 1D numpy array. If the waveform has more than one dimension, an error is raised.\n\nThe function also checks for some conditions that are not covered in the provided code snippet, such as checking if the window length equals the frame length and if the frame length is not larger than the FFT length.\n\nThe function also assumes that the input waveform is real-valued. If the waveform is complex-valued, an error is raised.\n\nThe function also assumes that the input waveform is in the range of [-1, 1]. If the waveform is not in this range, it may cause distortion in the spectrogram.\n\nThe function also assumes that the FFT length is a power of 2. If the FFT length is not a power of 2, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is a perfect reconstruction of a periodic signal. If the window is not a perfect reconstruction of a periodic signal, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is symmetric. If the window is not symmetric, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is normalized. If the window is not normalized, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is zero-mean. If the window is not zero-mean, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is a real-valued signal. If the window is not real-valued, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is periodic. If the window is not periodic, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is a function of time. If the window is not a function of time, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is a function of frequency. If the window is not a function of frequency, the STFT may not work correctly.\n\nThe function also assumes that the window is a function of the frequency-time plane. If the window is not a function of the frequency-"]}

If setup_nodes is True, node trees are set up for the molecular object and frames.\n\nThe function starts by reading in the topology and trajectory files. It then creates a molecular object with the positions of the first frame and the bonds from the topology object.

If the 'frames' file only contained one timepoint, the function returns the object without creating a collection for storing multiple frames from a trajectory.

It first checks if the batch contains more than one example and raises a ValueError if it does. Then it proceeds to randomly drop captions/conditioning based on a dropout probability. After that, it collects the luminance values of the examples. Finally, it extracts the latents, prompt embeddings, additional text embeddings, and time ids of the examples and returns them in a dictionary.\n\nThe function uses list comprehension to extract the required data from the examples. It also uses the sum and len functions to compute the average luminance.\n\nThe function returns a dictionary with the keys 'latent_batch', 'prompt_embeds', 'add_text_embeds', 'batch_time_ids', and 'batch_luminance'. The values of these keys are the respective data extracted from the examples.\n\nThe function also uses the debug_log function to log the progress of the collate function.\n\nThe function is designed to be used with a training loop that expects a single batch at a time. If you need to handle multiple batches in a single collate, you will need to modify the function accordingly.\n"]}

If the status code of the response is 200 (which means the request was successful), the function reads the data from the response and saves it to a file using the `_save_file` function. If the status code is not 200, an error message is logged. If any exception occurs during the request, another error message is logged.\n\nThe `_save_file` function is defined inside the `download_profile` function to keep the code clean and modular. It takes the data and a directory name as arguments, creates the directory if it doesn't exist, and writes the data to a file in the specified directory.\n\nThe `aiohttp.ClientSession` is used to make the GET request asynchronously, which is more efficient than making multiple requests one by one.\n\nThe `await` keyword is used to wait for the `resp.read()` method to complete, which is an asynchronous operation.\n\nThe `async with` statement is used to create a context manager that can be used to manage the session asynchronously. The session is automatically closed when the context manager is exited.\n\nThe `try-except` block is used to catch any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code.\n\nThe `resp.status` attribute is used to check the status code of the response.\n\nThe `resp.read()` method is used to read the data from the response. This is an asynchronous operation, so the `await` keyword is used to wait for it to complete.\n\nThe `os.path.join` function is used to join the storage path and the directory name to get the full path of the file.\n\nThe `os.makedirs` function is used to create the directory if it doesn't exist. The `exist_ok=True` argument is used to avoid an error if the directory already exists.\n\nThe `with open(path, \"wb\") as f:` statement is used to open the file in binary write mode and write the data to it.\n\nThe `str(e)` function is used to convert the exception to a string so it can be logged.\n\nThe `_LOGGER.error` function is used to log error messages.\n\nThe `_LOGGER.info` function is used to log informational messages.\n\nThe `ENDPOINT_DOWNLOAD` constant is used to specify the endpoint for downloading the profile from Github.\n\nThe `os` module is used to interact with the operating system, in this case, to create directories and join paths.\n\nThe `aiohttp` module is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests.\n\nThe `async with` statement is used to create a context manager that can be used to manage the session asynchronously. The session is automatically closed when the context manager is exited.\n\nThe `await` keyword is used to wait for the `resp.read()` method to complete, which is an asynchronous operation.\n\nThe `try-except` block is used to catch any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code.\n\nThe `resp.status` attribute is used to check the status code of the response.\n\nThe `resp.read()` method is used to read the data from the response.

This DataFrame is created by assigning the values of the predicted trend to different categories (decline_accelerating, decline_decelerating, growth_decelerating, growth_accelerating, steady) based on the sign and magnitude of the acceleration.\n\nThe function then plots this DataFrame using the plot method of pandas DataFrames. The plot is styled with a grid, legend, and rotated x-axis labels for better readability. If a start_date is not provided, the function uses the last date of the trend data. If a vertical line is provided, the function adds it to the plot. The plot is then displayed using plt.show(). The function returns the matplotlib Axes object containing the plot.\n\nThe colors of the lines in the plot are determined by the colors parameter, which defaults to a list of four colors. The function also sets the x-label and y-label of the plot to \"Date\" and \"Value\" respectively.\n\nThe function also handles the case where a vertical line is provided as a sequence of x-coordinates. In this case, the function adds each of these lines to the plot.\n\nThe function uses the plot method of pandas DataFrames to create the plot.

The function first splits the input waveform into frames of a specified length using `librosa.util.frame`. Then, it applies a window function to each frame. After that, it computes the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the frames using `librosa.stft`. The magnitude spectrogram is then computed by taking the power of the STFT. If a mel filterbank is provided, it is applied to the magnitude spectrogram. The mel floor is then applied to the magnitude spectrogram. If a log scale is requested, it is applied to the magnitude spectrogram. Finally, the spectrogram is returned as a numpy array of the specified data type.\n\nNote: The `librosa` library is not a built-in Python library, it is a third-party library for audio and music analysis. You need to install it using pip: `pip install librosa`.\n"]}

The constraints ensure that each observation is matched with at most `n_matches` and at least 1 other observation. The objective function is to minimize the total distance between matched pairs.

The function then returns the resulting tensor.\n\nThe function also checks if the device is \"cpu\" and the data type is `torch.bfloat16`, in which case it uses the `cast` function to convert the tensor to the desired data type.\n\nThe TODO comment indicates that the function does not currently support `torch.bfloat16` on CPU. This is likely a limitation of the PyTorch library, and may need to be addressed in the future.\n\nThe function is incomplete, so the missing part is to complete the function body.\n\n### Code completion:\n```Python\n        torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()), dtype)\n        else:\n            return cast(torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()) + k * torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()), dtype)\n    else:\n        # TODO: torch.eye doesn't support bfloat16 with cpu\n        if get_device() == \"cpu\" and dtype == torch.bfloat16:\n            return cast(\n        torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()), dtype)\n        else:\n            return cast(torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()) + k * torch.eye(N, M, dtype=dtype, device=get_device()), dtype)\n```\n\nThis completes the function by adding the offset to the identity matrix. The `cast` function is used to convert the resulting tensor to the desired data type.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes the existence of the `get_device` and `cast` functions, which are not provided in the original code snippet. You may need to implement these functions or replace them with the appropriate code based on your specific requirements.\n"]}

It first initializes an empty dictionary `raw` to store the parsed form data and another dictionary `unparsed` to store any unparsed data.\n\nThe function then iterates over all keys in the form data. For each key, it checks if it's in the mapping `_FORM_TO_RAW_MAPPING`. If it is, it gets the corresponding raw name. If the raw name is `None`, it skips the current iteration.\n\nIf the raw name is in `_STRING_FIELDS`, it checks if the value is a list of a single item. If it is, it unwraps the string from the list and stores it in `raw`.\n\nIf the raw name is in `_LIST_FIELDS`, it directly stores the value in `raw`.\n\nIf the raw name is in `_DICT_FIELDS`, it splits each item in the value into a key-value pair and stores them in `raw`.\n\nIf the raw name is not in any of the above categories, it stores the value in `unparsed`.\n\nFinally, if there are any unparsed data, it raises an `ExceptionGroup` with `InvalidMetadata` exceptions. Otherwise, it returns a `Metadata` object created from the parsed data.\n\nThe function uses the `from_raw` method of the `Metadata` class to cast the raw data to a `Metadata` object.\n\nThe `ExceptionGroup` is a new feature in Python 3.10 and it's used to group multiple exceptions together. The `InvalidMetadata` exception is raised when a specific field has invalid data.\n\nThe `_FORM_TO_RAW_MAPPING`, `_STRING_FIELDS`, `_LIST_FIELDS`, and `_DICT_FIELDS` are assumed to be defined in the scope of the function.\n\nThe `Metadata` and `MultiDict` classes are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe function assumes that the form data is a dictionary-like object where keys are field names and values are lists of field values. The function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has a `from_raw` method that takes a dictionary and returns a `Metadata` object.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has an `InvalidMetadata` exception that is raised when a specific field has invalid data.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has an `ExceptionGroup` exception that is raised when there are any unparsed data.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has a `_FORM_TO_RAW_MAPPING`, `_STRING_FIELDS`, `_LIST_FIELDS`, and `_DICT_FIELDS` attributes that define the mapping, string fields, list fields, and dictionary fields respectively.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `MultiDict` class has a `getall` method that takes a field name and returns a list of all values for that field.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `MultiDict` class has a `keys` method that returns an iterable of all field names in the form data.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has a `from_raw` method that takes a dictionary and returns a `Metadata` object.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `Metadata` class has an `InvalidMetadata` exception that is raised when a specific field has invalid data.\n\nThe function also assumes that"]}

For each pair, it iterates over each tensor in the model of the pair. It then adds the product of the tensor and the weight of the pair to the corresponding tensor in the `model`.\n\nAfter all pairs have been processed, it divides each tensor in the `model` by the total number of tensors (`total_tensors`). This is the final aggregated model.\n\nThe `copy.deepcopy(tensor)` in the original code is not necessary because we are modifying the `model.tensors` list in-place. If we were creating a new list of tensors, we would need to use `copy.deepcopy(tensor)` to ensure that the original tensors are not modified when we modify the new list. However, since we are modifying the `model.tensors` list in-place, we do not need to use `copy.deepcopy(tensor)`.\n\nThe `if sample_model.encrypted:` line is checking if any of the models in the list are encrypted. If any are, it raises a `RuntimeError` because encrypted tensors cannot be aggregated using the Federated Average.\n\nThe `total_tensors = len(model.tensors)` line is calculating the total number of tensors in the `model`. This is used to normalize the aggregated model by dividing each tensor by the total number of tensors.\n\nThe `return model` line is returning the final aggregated model.\n"]}

The `slot_mapping` list is used to map each token in the prompt to a slot in the model's attention mechanism. If the token is part of the context (i.e., it is in a block that has been computed), it is mapped to a slot number. If the token is part of the prompt (i.e., it is in a block that has not been computed), it is mapped to the `_PAD_SLOT_ID` constant, which is a special slot number that indicates that the corresponding token should be ignored by the model.\n\nThe function then returns a `PreparePromptMetadata` object containing all the prepared metadata.\n\nThe `PreparePromptMetadata` class is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a class that takes the following arguments: `input_tokens`, `input_positions`, `slot_mapping`, `lora_index_mapping`, `lora_prompt_mapping`, `lora_requests`, `prompt_lens`, `context_lens`, `subquery_lens`, `prefix_block_tables`, and `multi_modal_input`.\n\nThe `_PAD_SLOT_ID` constant is also not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a constant that represents the special slot number for padding tokens.\n\nThe `SequenceGroupMetadata` and `LoRARequest` classes are also not defined in the provided code snippet, but they are assumed to be classes that hold the necessary information for sequence group metadata and LoRA requests, respectively.\n\nThe `torch.Tensor` type is also not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a type that represents a tensor of data in PyTorch.\n\nThe `PreparePromptMetadata` class and the `torch.Tensor` type are used in the function signature, so they should be defined in the code that calls this function.\n\nThe function also uses the `assert` statement to check that certain conditions are met, such as that the length of `seq_group_metadata_list` is not zero. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `RuntimeError`.\n\nThe function also uses the `list` and `set` types to store data, and the `min` function to find the minimum of two values. These are standard Python features.\n\nThe function uses the `extend` method of the `list` type to add elements to the end of a list, and the `append` method to add a single element to the end of a list. These are standard Python features.\n\nThe function uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over a list and get both the index and value of each element. This is a standard Python feature.\n\n"]}

The `Retry` policy is created using the `util.Retry` class, which takes several parameters such as `total` (total number of retries), `status_forcelist` (HTTP status codes that should trigger a retry), `method_whitelist` (HTTP methods that should trigger a retry), and `backoff_factor` (the backoff factor to apply in the case of a 503 server response).\n\nThe `method_whitelist` is set to `allowed_methods`, which is a set containing the default allowed methods for retries (`util.Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`) and, if `include_post` is `True`, \"POST\".\n\nFinally, the `HTTPAdapter` instance is created with the `Retry` policy as its `max_retries`, and this instance is returned.\n\nThe `supply_settings` parameter is a callable that returns a `ResilienceSettings` object, which is used to configure the `Retry` policy. The `config.ResilienceSettings` is a default `ResilienceSettings` object, but it can be overridden by providing a different callable.\n\nThe `include_post` parameter is a flag that determines whether to include the \"POST\" method in the allowed methods for retries. If `include_post` is `True`, \"POST\" is added to `allowed_methods`.\n\nThe function is annotated with type hints for the arguments and return value, which are used by tools like mypy and IDEs to provide better autocompletion and type checking.\n"]}

This function takes the input grid cell, the transformation matrix, the desired output shape, the mode of the transformation, the order of the transformation, and any additional keyword arguments. The function then returns the transformed grid.\n\nThe transformation matrix `tr` is calculated by inverting the forward transformation matrix `forward_t`. The forward transformation matrix is calculated by scaling the cell's dcell by the scaling factors `scales` and transposing the result. The scaling factors are calculated by dividing the desired output shape by the lengths of the projected cell's axes.\n\nThe function then returns a new grid with the transformed cell.\n"]}

It takes a dictionary `dic` as input, which contains annotations, semantic segmentation, and semantic segmentation file name. The function then extracts the necessary information from the dictionary and uses it to draw the annotations, segmentation, and semantic segmentation on the image. The function returns the image with the drawn instances, segmentation, and semantic segmentation.\n\nThe function first checks if the annotations exist in the dictionary. If they do, it extracts the segmentation, keypoints, and bounding boxes from the annotations. It also extracts the labels from the annotations. If the instance mode is set to `ColorMode.SEGMENTATION` and there are thing colors in the metadata, it generates colors for the labels.\n\nIf the semantic segmentation exists in the dictionary, it converts the semantic segmentation to a numpy array. If the semantic segmentation file name exists in the dictionary, it converts it to a string.\n\nIf the instance mode is set to `ColorMode.IMAGE_BW`, it sets the ground truth mask to the semantic segmentation. If the instance mode is also `ColorMode.IMAGE_BW`, it sets the ground truth classes to the labels.\n\nFinally, it draws the annotations, segmentation, and semantic segmentation on the image using the `draw_instance_predictions` and `draw_sem_seg` methods. It returns the image with the drawn instances, segmentation, and semantic segmentation.\n"]}

The `docs_url` is set to `None` to disable the default FastAPI documentation route.\n\nThe `index`, `favicon`, `docs`, and `health` routes are defined. The `index` route redirects to the `/docs` route. The `favicon` route returns a favicon file if it exists, otherwise it raises an HTTP exception. The `docs` route returns the Swagger UI HTML. The `health` route returns a health response with a status of \"OK\".\n\nThe `get_endpoint` route returns an endpoint with the given name if it exists, otherwise it raises an HTTP exception.

The `elastic_net_penalty` function calculates the elastic net penalty for a given set of inputs, and the `obj_fcn` function is the objective function to be minimized. The `obj_fcn` function calls the `elastic_net_penalty` function to calculate the penalty term of the objective function. The objective function is the weighted root mean squared error (wRMSE) plus the penalty term. The wRMSE is calculated by comparing the model's predictions with the observed values, and the penalty term is calculated by applying the elastic net penalty to the model's coefficients. The `obj_fcn` function returns the value of the objective function.\n\nThe `elastic_net_penalty` function uses the L1 penalty (lasso) and L2 penalty (ridge) of the elastic net method. The L1 penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, and the L2 penalty is the sum of the squares of the coefficients. The penalty term is a weighted sum of these two penalties, where the weight is determined by the `alpha` parameter. The `alpha` parameter controls the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties. If `alpha` is 0, the penalty is a combination of the L1 and L2 penalties. If `alpha` is 1, the penalty is a combination of the L1 and L2 penalties, but the L1 penalty has twice the weight of the L2 penalty. If `alpha` is greater than 1, the penalty is a combination of the L1 and L2 penalties, but the L1 penalty has more weight than the L2 penalty.\n\nThe `obj_fcn` function uses the `T` and `obs` arrays to calculate the weighted root mean squared error (wRMSE) of the model's predictions. The wRMSE is calculated by comparing the model's predictions with the observed values, and the weights are determined by the `weight_fcn` function. The `weight_fcn` function calculates the weights for the observations based on the temperature values and a quantile threshold. The `obj_fcn` function returns the value of the objective function, which is the wRMSE plus the penalty term.\n\nThe `obj"]}

It first initializes an empty dictionary `dst` with keys as column names and values as empty lists. Then it iterates over the EventSet data. For each data point, it appends the timestamp and the feature values to the corresponding lists in `dst`. Finally, it converts the lists in `dst` to numpy arrays and returns the dictionary. If `timestamp_to_datetime` is True, it converts the timestamps to datetime64[s] by adding the Unix epoch time to the timestamps.\n"]}

The configuration is loaded by calling the `load` function for each key in the `mappings` dictionary. The `load` function is responsible for setting the corresponding attribute of the `Language` object based on the value from the YAML file. If the value is a string, it is converted to a boolean if it matches \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nThe `load` function is called for each key in the `mappings` dictionary. The key is the attribute name in the YAML file, and the value is the attribute name in the `Language` object. The `load` function checks if the key exists in the YAML file, and if it does, it sets the corresponding attribute of the `Language` object to the value from the YAML file.\n\nThe function then returns the `Language` object.\n\nThe `mappings` dictionary is used to map the attribute names in the YAML file to the attribute names in the `Language` object. This allows the function to load the configuration from the YAML file and set the corresponding attributes of the `Language` object.\n\nThe function uses the `yaml.safe_load` function to load the YAML file. This function is safe because it does not execute any arbitrary Python code that might be in the YAML file. It only loads the data from the YAML file and does not execute any Python code.\n\nThe function opens the YAML file in read mode and uses the UTF-8 encoding to handle any special characters in the file. The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after it is no longer needed.\n\nThe function uses the `isinstance` function to check if the value is a string. If it is, the function converts the string to a boolean if it matches \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nThe function uses the `setattr` function to set the corresponding attribute of the `Language` object. The `setattr` function takes three arguments: the object, the attribute name, and the value.\n\nThe function uses the `getattr` function to get the value of the corresponding attribute of the `Language` object. The `getattr` function takes three arguments: the object, the attribute name, and a default value. If the attribute does not exist, the function returns the default value.\n\nThe function uses the `hasattr` function to check if the `Language` object has a certain attribute. The `hasattr` function takes two arguments: the object and the attribute name. If the attribute exists, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n```Python\n    # Complete the function\n    load(\"name\", \"name\")\n    load(\"show_romanization\", \"show_romanization\")\n    load(\"right_to_left\", \"right_to_left\")\n    load(\"parser_type\", \"parser_type\")\n    load(\"character_substitutions\", \"character_substitutions\")\n    load(\"split_sentences\", \"regexp_split_sentences\")\n    load(\"split_sentence_exceptions\", \"exceptions_split_sentences\")\n    load(\"word_chars\", \"word_characters\")\n\n    return lang\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `get_demo_language` is loading a language configuration from a YAML file and returning a `Language` object.

The function takes in the strain values and corresponding stress values, and returns a function that can be used to calculate the stress value corresponding to any given strain value. The `kind` parameter is set to 'linear' to specify that a linear interpolation should be used.\n\nThe returned function is then used to calculate and return the stress value corresponding to the given strain value.\n\nThe `interp1d` function is a part of the `scipy` library, which is a scientific computing library in Python. It is used for a variety of tasks, including interpolation, integration, optimization, linear algebra, and more.\n\nThe `scipy` library is not a built-in Python library, so it must be installed separately using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install scipy\n```\n\nThe `scipy` library is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis in Python.\n"]}

If it does, it uses the find_points_in_spheres function from scipy.sparse to find the points within a certain cutoff distance. It then excludes self-interactions and interactions that are too close to the numerical tolerance. If the Atoms object does not have periodic boundary conditions, it calculates the distance between all pairs of atoms and creates an adjacency matrix. It then converts the adjacency matrix to a coordinate list format and excludes self-interactions.\n\nThe function then calls the get_graph_from_processed_structure method of the superclass to generate the graph. The superclass method takes the Atoms object, the source and destination indices of the edges, the periodic images of the edges, the lattice matrix, the element types, and the scaled positions (if periodic boundary conditions are present) or the cartesian coordinates (otherwise).

If the Atoms object has periodic boundary conditions, the function uses the `find_points_in_spheres` function from scipy.sparse to find the points within a certain cutoff distance. If the Atoms object does not have periodic boundary conditions, it calculates the distance between all pairs of atoms and creates an adjacency matrix. The function then converts the adjacency matrix to a coordinate list format and excludes self-interactions. The function then calls the `get_graph_from_processed_structure` method of the superclass to generate the graph. The function returns the generated graph, the lattice matrix, and the state attributes.\n\nThe completed code snippet creates the adjacency matrix and excludes self-interactions based on the presence of periodic boundary conditions. It then calls the `get_graph_from_processed_structure` method of the superclass to generate the graph. The function returns the generated graph, the lattice matrix, and the state attributes.\n"]}

It first computes the mean of each tensor and subtracts it from the tensor. Then, it computes the covariance matrix of the tensor. The covariance matrix is added to the overall covariance matrix. After all tensors have been processed, the function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the overall covariance matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are then sorted in descending order. The function returns a tuple containing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nThe function uses PyTorch's `torch.symeig` function to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The `eigenvectors=True` argument is used to also compute the eigenvectors. The `argsort` function is used to sort the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in descending order. The `descending=True` argument is used to sort in descending order.\n\nThe function also uses PyTorch's `torch.mean` function to compute the mean of the tensor. The `dim=0` argument is used to compute the mean along the first dimension.\n\nThe function also uses PyTorch's `torch.mm` function to compute the matrix multiplication of two tensors. The `torch.t` function is used to compute the transpose of a tensor.\n\nThe function uses the `cleanup_memory` function to clean up GPU memory. The `config.device` variable is used to specify the device on which to perform the computations.\n\nThe function uses the `ignore_masks` argument to ignore certain elements in the tensors. The `ignore_masks[idx] == 0` condition is used to ignore the elements in the tensor that correspond to the mask.\n\nThe function assumes that the tensors are 2D and that the tensors are on the same device.\n"]}

If a firmware list is found, it sorts the list by the filename and returns it.\n\nThe function `downloaded_firmwares` is used to get the list of downloaded firmware files. The function `filter_downloaded_fwlist` is used to filter this list by the provided parameters. The function `clean_version` is used to clean the version string.\n\nThe function `log.error` is used to log an error message. The `config.firmware_folder` is used as the default firmware folder if no folder is provided.\n\nThe function uses the `lambda` function to sort the firmware list by the filename. The `key` argument of the `sort` function is a function that takes a firmware and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, it returns the filename of the firmware.\n\nThe function returns a list of `FWInfo` objects. The `FWInfo` objects represent the found firmware and contain information about the firmware, such as the filename, the board ID, the version, and so on.\n\nThe function raises a `loguru.logger.error` if no firmware files are found.\n\nThe function uses the `Optional` type hint for the `fw_folder` and `selector` arguments. This means that these arguments are optional and can be `None`.\n\nThe function uses the `*` operator to allow for named arguments. This means that the function can be called with named arguments, which makes the code more readable.\n\nThe function uses the `:` operator to specify the type of the arguments and the return value. This makes the code more type-safe and helps to prevent errors.\n\nThe function uses the `def` keyword to define the function. The function is a method of the `loguru.logger` module.\n\nThe function uses the `return` keyword to return the value. The function also uses the `if` and `else` keywords to control the flow of the code.\n\nThe function uses the `and` and `or` keywords to combine conditions. The `and` keyword returns `True` if both conditions are `True`, and the `or` keyword returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.\n\nThe function uses the `==` operator to compare values. The `==` operator returns `True` if the values are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `not` keyword to negate a condition. The `not` keyword returns `True` if the condition is `False`, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `in` keyword to check if a value is in a list. The `in` keyword returns `True` if the value is in the list, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `str` and `int` functions to convert values to strings and integers, respectively. The `str` function converts a value to a string, and the `int` function converts a value to an integer.\n\nThe function uses the `loguru.logger.error` function to log an error message. The `loguru.logger.error` function takes a string as an argument, which is the message to log.\n\nThe function uses the `f\"...\"` syntax to format a string. This syntax is used to include the values of variables in the string. The `f\"...\"` syntax is called an f-string.\n\nThe function uses the `lambda` keyword to define a small anonymous function. The `lambda` keyword is followed by the"]}

If so, it processes the gap information to identify the gaps. It then iterates over each gap, drawing it and its markers if specified.\n\nFinally, the function adds any custom gaps specified in the `custom_gaps` parameter.

Finally, it returns the list of bodies and the updated schemas.\n\nThe function also handles the case where there are multiple content types by setting the `prefix_type_names` variable to `True` if there are more than one content types.\n\nThe function uses the `get_content_type` function to simplify the content type, which is not provided in the original code snippet.

The `Body` class should have attributes for the body type, schema, content type, prefix type names, and endpoint name.\n\nThe `ParseError` class is also not provided in the original code snippet. It should have attributes for the detail, data, and level of the error. The `ErrorLevel` class should have three attributes: `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`.\n\nThe `Schemas` class and `Config` classes are also not provided in the original code snippet. They should be defined elsewhere in the code. The `Schemas` class should have a method `get_schema` that takes a schema name as an argument and returns the corresponding schema, or `None` if there is no such schema.\n\nThe `oai.Operation` class is also not provided in the original code snippet. It should be defined elsewhere in the code. It should have an attribute `request_body` that is either an instance of the `oai.RequestBody` class or an instance of the `oai.Reference` class.

It first checks if the number of source files (`pt_files`) is equal to the number of destination files (`sf_files`). If not, it raises an assertion error.\n\nThe function then iterates over the `pt_files` and `sf_files` lists using the `zip` function. For each pair of files, it checks if the name of the source file is in the `discard_names` list. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves to the next pair of files.\n\nIf the source file is not blacklisted, the function proceeds to convert the file. This is where you would add your conversion code.\n\nAfter the conversion, the function prints a message indicating that the file has been converted and its position in the list of files.\n\nThe function does not return any value, as indicated by the `None` return type annotation.\n"]}

The roots are reshaped to match the dimensions of `x` if `tensor` is `True`. The function then returns the product of the differences between `x` and `r` along the last axis.\n\nThe `np.prod` function is used to calculate the product of array elements over a given axis. The `axis=-1` argument specifies that the product should be calculated along the last axis.\n\nThe `np.reshape` function is used to reshape the roots array to match the dimensions of `x`. The `-1` argument in the reshape function tells numpy to calculate the appropriate dimension based on the original size of the array and the new size of the array.\n\nThe `np.asarray` function is used to convert `x` to an array if it is not already an array.\n\nThe `np.array` function is used to create an array from `r`. The `ndmin` and `copy` arguments are used to specify the minimum number of dimensions and whether to copy the input array.\n\nThe `np.double` function is used to convert the data type of `r` to double if it is not already double.\n\nThe `isinstance` function is used to check if `x` is a tuple or a list.\n\nThe `dtype.char` attribute is used to get the data type characters of `r`. If `r` is a boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, or complex array, the data type characters are '?', 'b', 'B', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'q', 'Q', and 'P', respectively. If `r` is any of these types, the data type of `r` is converted to double using the `astype` function.\n\nThe `ndim` attribute is used to get the number of dimensions of `x`.\n\nThe `copy=False` argument in the `np.array` function is used to prevent creating a copy of `r` if it is not necessary.\n\nThe `astype` function is used to convert `r` to a double array if it is not already a double array.\n\nThe `np.prod` function is used to calculate the product of the differences between `x` and `r` along the last axis.\n\nThe `np.reshape` function is used to reshape `r` to match the dimensions of `x` if `tensor` is `True`.\n\nThe `isinstance` function is used to check if `x` is a tuple or a list.\n\nThe `np.asarray` function is used to convert `x` to an array if it is not already an array.\n\nThe `np.array` function is used to create an array from `r`.

It first checks if the directory for the node exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Then, it runs the query expansion and measures the execution time for each module. It saves the results to a folder and creates a summary DataFrame. If there are more than one module, it filters the results by a threshold if it is provided, evaluates the results using the provided metrics, and selects the best result based on these metrics. If there is only one module, it directly selects the best result. The function returns the best result DataFrame.\n\nThe function uses the `map` function to apply a function to each element of a list, the `zip` function to combine two lists into a list of tuples, the `os.path.exists` function to check if a directory exists, the `os.makedirs` function to create a directory, the `deepcopy` function to create a deep copy of an object, and the `pandas` library to handle DataFrames.\n\nThe function raises a `ValueError` if no metrics are provided in the strategies for evaluation.\n\nThe function `evaluate_metric` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it is assumed to be a function that takes a row of a DataFrame, a metric name, and a strategy, and returns the evaluation result of the metric on the row according to the strategy.\n\nThe function `measure_speed` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it is assumed to be a function that takes a module, a project directory, a previous result DataFrame, and parameters for the module, and returns the result of the module and the execution time.\n\nThe function `evaluate_metric` and `measure_speed` are used in the function `run_query_expansion_node`, so they should be defined in the code.\n"]}

It starts by finding the most similar item to the query. Then, it calculates the redundancy score and query score for each item. The final score is a weighted sum of the query score and the redundancy score, with the weight determined by the `lambda_mult` parameter. The item with the highest score is then added to the list of selected items, and the process is repeated until `k` items have been selected. The indices of the selected items are then returned.\n\nThe `cosine_similarity` function is used to calculate the cosine similarity between the query and each item in the list, and between the selected items and all other items in the list. The cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which is used to measure the similarity between items in an embedding space.\n\nThe `np.argmax` function is used to find the index of the item with the highest score. The `np.vstack` function is used to stack the selected items vertically.\n\nThe function also checks if `k` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns an empty list. It also checks if the dimensions of the query embedding are 1, in which case it expands the dimensions of the query embedding to 2.\n\nThe function assumes that the `embedding_list` is a list of numpy arrays, and that the `query_embedding` is a numpy array. If the `query_embedding` has dimensions 1, it is expanded to 2 by adding an extra dimension.\n\nThe function also assumes that the `cosine_similarity` function from the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module is available.\n"]}

It first checks if the input matrix is already positive definite using the Cholesky decomposition. If it is, it returns the matrix as it is.\n\nIf the input matrix is not positive definite, it converts the covariance matrix to a correlation matrix. If the `higham` flag is set to `True`, it applies the Higham's algorithm to the correlation matrix to find the nearest positive definite matrix. The Higham's algorithm involves iteratively adjusting the matrix until it becomes positive definite.\n\nIf the Higham's algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations, it raises a `ValueError`. If the input matrix is not positive semi-definite, it also raises a `ValueError`.\n\nFinally, it converts the correlation matrix back to a covariance matrix using the standard deviations and returns the resulting positive definite covariance matrix.\n\nThe function uses several helper functions such as `assert_is_square`, `assert_is_symmetric`, `cov_to_corr`, `is_cholesky_dec`, `is_positive_definite`, `corr_to_cov`, which are not provided in the code snippet.\n\nThe function assumes that the input matrix is a square, symmetric, and positive semi-definite matrix. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.\n"]}

If no data type is provided, it defaults to `torch.float32`. If an unsupported data type is provided, it raises a `ValueError`. If the `bf16` precision is requested but not available on the hardware, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The function also takes a `device` argument, which is used to specify the device on which the tensor is to be created. If no device is provided, it defaults to the default device (`cuda` if available, otherwise `cpu`).\n\nThe function uses a dictionary `PRECISION_STR_TO_DTYPE` to map string representations of data types to their corresponding `torch.dtype` objects. The function then checks if the provided data type is one of the supported precisions. If it is not, it raises a `ValueError` with a list of the supported precisions.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the `bf16` precision is requested and if it is not available on the hardware. If it is, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it returns the data type.\n"]}

It takes a list of routes as input, and if no routes are provided, it uses the routes registered with the FastAPI application.\n\nThe function first generates the base OpenAPI specification using the `get_openapi` function. Then, it loops over the registered controllers and gets the action exceptions. It also checks if the url of the controller is in the openapi_base[\"paths\"], if not, it ignores this controller.\n\nIf there are exceptions, it formats them and stores them in a dictionary `exceptions_by_url`.\n\nNext, it checks for duplicate schema names and if there are any, it renames them. It does this by creating a dictionary `schema_names_to_long` that maps short schema names to long schema names.\n\nFinally, it updates the OpenAPI specification with the new schema names and returns the OpenAPI specification as a dictionary.\n\nThe function uses the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module to handle the case where a short schema name is used multiple times. It ensures that each short schema name is associated with a unique long schema name.\n\nThe function also uses the `_get_unique_schema_name` method to generate a unique long schema name for each short schema name. This method ensures that the long schema name is unique across all schema names.\n\nThe function uses the `_format_exception_model` method to format the exception models.
