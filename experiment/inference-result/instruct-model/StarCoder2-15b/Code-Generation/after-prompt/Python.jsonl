It is trained on a massive amount of text data and can generate human-like text.\n\nThe LLaMA model is available in the following checkpoints:\n\n| Model name | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- |\n| [llama-7b](llama-7b) | LLaMA 7B model |\n| [llama-13b](llama-13b) | LLaMA 13B model |\n| [llama-30b](llama-30b) | LLaMA 30B model |\n| [llama-65b](llama-65b) | LLaMA 65B model |\n\nTo use the LLaMA model, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"llama-7b\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\nThe LLaMA model is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text. It is trained on a massive amount of text data and can understand and generate text in a wide range of languages. The model can be used for various tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and language understanding.\n\nThe LLaMA model is available in different sizes, with 7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B parameters. The larger the model, the more accurate it is, but it also requires more memory and computation.\n\nThe LLaMA model is trained on a large amount of text data, including web pages, books, and other documents. It is trained using a language modeling objective, which means it is trained to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words.\n\nThe LLaMA model is a Transformer-based model, which means it uses an attention mechanism to capture the relationships between different words in a sentence.

It uses the `alembic` library to compare the database metadata with the class metadata, and generates a new alembic revision if there are differences. The function returns `True` if changes were detected and migration scripts were written, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function takes the following arguments:\n- `cls`: The class that the function belongs to.\n- `connection`: The database connection to use.\n- `message`: The message to include in the alembic revision. Defaults to `None`.\n- `write_migration_scripts`: Whether to write the migration scripts. Defaults to `True`.\n\nThe function uses the `alembic` library to generate alembic migrations based on the provided class metadata. It first creates a `Config` object to configure the alembic environment, then creates a `MigrationContext` object to compare the database metadata with the class metadata. If there are differences, it generates a new alembic revision using the `revision` command and returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote that this function assumes the `alembic` library is already installed and the alembic environment is properly configured.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `alembic_autogenerate` function:\n\n```python\nfrom alembic_autogenerate import alembic_autogenerate\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String(255))\n    email = Column(String(255), unique=True)\n\nalembic_autogenerate(User, connection, message=\"Initial migration\", write_migration_scripts=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the `alembic_autogenerate` function and the necessary SQLAlchemy classes. Then, we define a `User` class that inherits from `Base` and has three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`.\n\nFinally, we call the `alembic_autogenerate` function with the `User` class, a database connection, a message, and `write_migration_scripts` set to `True`. This will generate an alembic revision based on the `User` class metadata and write the migration scripts to the `alembic` directory.\n\nNote that you need to have the `alembic` library installed and the alembic environment properly configured to use this function./docs/python/python-function-to-generate-"]}

It also assumes that each parameter has an `annotation` attribute, which is the type of the parameter, and a `default` attribute, which is the default value of the parameter.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `make_info` function to generate a Pydantic model for a given function signature:\n\n```Python\nimport inspect\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\ndef add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n    return x + y\n\nsignature = inspect.signature(add)\nmodel = make_info(signature)\n\nclass AddModel(model):\n    pass\n\nprint(AddModel.schema())\n```\n\nThis will print the following output:\n\n```Python\n{\n    \"title\": \"AddModel\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"x\": {\n            \"title\": \"X\",\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n        },\n        \"y\": {\n            \"title\": \"Y\",\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n        \"x\",\n        \"y\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe `make_info` function takes a `signature` object as input and generates a Pydantic model class `Model` with attributes corresponding to the parameters of the signature. The function iterates through the parameters of the signature and adds the corresponding attributes to the model class. If the parameter has an annotation, it is used as the type of the attribute, otherwise the type of the default value is used. Finally, the function returns the generated model class.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the signature object has a `parameters` attribute, which is a dictionary mapping parameter names to `inspect.Parameter` objects.

This task can be accomplished using a combination of video understanding and text generation models.\n\nFirst, a video understanding model is used to extract key frames from the video. These key frames are then passed to a text generation model, which generates a summary of the video.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this task using the [VideoMAE](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/videomae"]}

It takes the number of filters, the number of spectrogram bins, the sample rate, the lower and upper edges of the mel spectrum, and the data type of the output as inputs. The function returns a weight matrix of the specified shape and data type.\n\nThe function first initializes a matrix of zeros with the specified shape and data type. It then calculates the mel frequencies using the `np.linspace` function and the provided parameters. The bin frequencies are also calculated using the `np.linspace` function, but with a different range.\n\nThe function then loops over each filter and each spectrogram bin. For each filter, it finds the left and right mel frequencies, as well as the center mel frequency. For each spectrogram bin, it checks if the bin frequency is within the range of the left and center mel frequencies. If it is, it calculates the weight for that bin by dividing the difference between the bin frequency and the left mel frequency by the difference between the center and left mel frequencies. If the bin frequency is within the range of the center and right mel frequencies, it calculates the weight by dividing the difference between the right mel frequency and the bin frequency by the difference between the right and center mel frequencies.\n\nFinally, the function returns the mel weight matrix.\n\nThe mel weight matrix is a matrix of weights that can be used to convert a spectrogram from linear frequency to mel frequency. The rows of the matrix correspond to the mel filters, and the columns correspond to the spectrogram bins. The weights in the matrix are calculated based on the mel frequencies and the spectrogram bin frequencies. The weights are calculated as the ratio of the difference between the bin frequency and the left or right mel frequency to the difference between the center mel frequency and the left or right mel frequency, depending on which range the bin frequency falls into./docs/en/models/audio/wav2vec2.md\n# Wav2Vec2\n\n## Overview\n\nWav2Vec2 is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that was introduced in the paper [Wav2Vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477) by  et al."]}

It takes three arguments: `url`, `save_dir`, and `ignore_cert`. The `url` argument is the URL of the file to be downloaded, and the `save_dir` argument is the directory where the downloaded file will be saved. The `ignore_cert` argument is a boolean flag that indicates whether to ignore SSL certificate verification warnings.\n\nIf the `ignore_cert` flag is set to `True`, the function will create an unverified context using `ssl._create_unverified_context()` and pass it as the `context` argument to `urlopen()`. This will ignore any SSL certificate verification warnings.\n\nThe function then uses `urlretrieve()` to download the file from the `url` and save it to the `save_dir`.\n\nNote that this function does not handle any errors or exceptions. It is up to the caller to handle any potential issues that may arise during the download process./docs/en/tasks/question-answering/question-answering-task001.md\n<!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

Its capital is Paris.\", the model should answer \"Paris\".\n\nHere is an example of a question answering task:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nquestion_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\")\ncontext = \"France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital is Paris.\"\nquestion = \"What is the capital of France?\"\n\nresult = question_answerer(question=question, context=context)\nprint(f\"Answer: {result['answer']}\")\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```text\nAnswer: Paris\n```\n\nThe question answering task can be solved using a variety of models, including [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad), [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad), [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-squad2), and [XLNet](https://huggingface.co/xlnet-large-cased-finetuned-squad2).\nThese models are all fine-tuned on the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset, which contains questions and answers about a set of Wikipedia articles.\n\nHere is an example of how to use a question answering model with a context:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nquestion_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model=\"distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad\")"]}

Otherwise, it retrieves the existing buffer and updates it by multiplying it with the `momentum` value and adding the gradient.\n\nIn either case, the updated buffer is stored in `d_p`.\n\nFinally, the function updates the parameter by subtracting the scaled gradient from it. This update step is performed using the learning rate (`lr`) and the `d_p` value, which incorporates momentum and weight decay if applicable.\n\nThe `step` function is responsible for updating the model's parameters based on the gradients and other optimization settings. By iterating over the parameter groups and applying weight decay, momentum, and the learning rate, the function ensures that the parameters are updated in"]}

It uses a while loop to repeatedly call the `push_particles` method until the `is_terminated` method returns True. The `is_terminated` method should be defined in the class and should return a boolean value indicating whether the simulation should be terminated.\n\nThe `push_particles` method should also be defined in the class and should update the state of the particles based on the simulation rules.\n\nThe `run` method does not return any value, as it is only responsible for running the simulation.\n\nThe `is_terminated` method should check if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The simulation has reached the maximum number of time steps.\n2. All particles have reached their destination.\n3. The simulation has reached a specific time or iteration.\n4. The simulation has reached a specific state or condition.\n\nThe `push_particles` method should update the position and velocity of each particle based on the simulation rules. This method should also check for any collisions or interactions between particles and handle them appropriately.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `is_terminated` method and the `push_particles` method:\n\n```Python\ndef is_terminated(self) -> bool :\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function checks if the simulation should be terminated.\n\n    Args:\n        self: The instance of the class that this method belongs to.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the simulation should be terminated, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return self.time_step >= self.max_time_steps or all(particle.reached_destination for particle in self.particles)\n\ndef push_particles(self) -> None :\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function pushes the particles in the simulation.\n\n    Args:\n        self: The instance of the class that this method belongs to.\n\n    Returns:\n        None: This function does not return any value.\n    \"\"\"\n    for particle in self.particles:\n        particle.position += particle.velocity\n        if particle.position == particle.destination:\n            particle.velocity = 0\n        else:\n            particle.velocity += self.acceleration\n```\n\nThe `is_terminated` method checks if the simulation has reached the maximum number of time steps or if all particles have reached their destination.\n\nThe `push_particles` method updates the position and velocity of each particle based on the simulation rules. In this example, the particle's velocity is increased by the acceleration every time step, and the particle's position is updated based on its velocity. If the particle reaches its destination, its velocity is set to 0.\n\nThese methods are simple implementations of the `is_terminated` method and the `push_particles` method. They may not accurately represent the actual simulation rules or handle all possible scenarios. It's up to you to implement these methods based on the specific requirements of your simulation.\n\nThe `is_terminated` method should check if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The simulation has reached the maximum number of time steps.\n2. All particles have reached their destination.\n3. The simulation has reached a specific time or iteration.\n4.

It then calculates the minimum and maximum values of the indices along each dimension to determine the bounding box coordinates. Finally, it creates a `Boxes` object with the calculated coordinates and returns it.\n\nThe `np.nonzero` function returns a tuple of arrays, where each array corresponds to the indices of non-zero elements along a dimension. By taking the minimum and maximum values of these arrays, we can determine the bounding box coordinates.\n\nThe `Boxes` class is a custom class that may be defined in the code or provided as part of the problem description. It is responsible for storing the bounding box coordinates and may have methods to access or manipulate them.\n\nThe function returns a `Boxes` object containing the bounding box coordinates, which can be used to perform further operations or display the bounding boxes./docs/en/models/llama.md\n# LLaMA\n\n## Model Description\n\nLLaMA is a series of open-source language models trained on the [Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset. The models are trained using the [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) training code and the [HF Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.\n\nThe model is a Transformer-based language model with a decoder-only architecture. It consists of a stack of Transformer layers, each of which contains a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward network. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, including web pages, books, and other documents.\n\nThe model is designed to be efficient and effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, question answering, and language understanding. It can be fine-tuned on specific tasks to improve performance on those tasks.\n\n## Model Usage\n\nThe model can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and language understanding. Here are some examples of how to use the model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/llama-7b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/llama-7b\")\n\ninput_text = \"I want to learn about\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutput_ids = model.generate(input_ids)\noutput_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint(output_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, the model is used to generate text based on the input text \"I want to learn about\". The `generate` method is used to generate the output text.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/llama-7b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\"facebook/llama-7b\")\n\nquestion = \"What is the capital of France?\"\ncontext = \"France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital is Paris.\"\n\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(question, context, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nstart_logits, end_logits = model(input_ids).logits\nstart_index = start_logits.argmax().item()\nend_index = end_logits.argmax().item()\nanswer = tokenizer.decode(input_ids[0, start_index:end_index+1], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint(answer"]}

The function returns a 2-dimensional array where the element at position (i, j) is the cosine similarity between the i-th index vector and the j-th query vector.\n\nThe function first calculates the norm of the query vector and each index vector using `np.linalg.norm`. Then, it calculates the dot product of the query vector and each index vector using `np.dot`. Finally, it divides the dot product by the product of the norms to get the cosine similarity.\n\nThe `np.linalg.norm` function calculates the norm of a vector, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements. The `np.dot` function calculates the dot product of two vectors, which is the sum of the product of the corresponding elements. Dividing the dot product by the product of the norms gives the cosine similarity, which is a measure of the angle between the two vectors./docs/chatgpt-prompts/python/python-function-to-calculate-the-sum-of-the-first-n-terms-of-the-fibonacci-sequence.md\n# Python function to calculate the sum of the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence"]}
